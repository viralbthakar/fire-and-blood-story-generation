00:22:56,237 --> 00:22:59,156
Thank you...
for your generosity.

326
00:23:02,117 --> 00:23:04,787
I would be honored

327
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:07,957
to take the Princess Rhaenyra
to wife, Your Grace.

328
00:23:09,208 --> 00:23:09,917
What I offer you,

329
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,170
the crown and your daughter,

330
00:23:13,253 --> 00:23:16,799
is strength.

331
00:23:16,882 --> 00:23:21,428
Do you think that House
Targaryen wants for strength?

332
00:23:21,512 --> 00:23:23,097
If someone offered you more dragons,

333
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,015
would you not take them?

334
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:27,768
Do you have dragons to offer?

335
00:23:30,145 --> 00:23:32,523
Casterly Rock is a splendid seat.

336
00:23:32,606 --> 00:23:35,025
Rhaenyra may take her place
there by my side without shame,

337
00:23:35,109 --> 00:23:37,528
and feel herself well-compensated

338
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:38,696
for her loss in station.

339
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:42,366
What loss of station?

340
00:23:42,449 --> 00:23:45,869
If you were to name
young Aegon heir, Your Grace.

341
00:23:45,953 --> 00:23:48,080
And when would I be doing that?

342
00:23:49,331 --> 00:23:52,376
I had assumed--
as he's your firstborn son--

343
00:23:52,459 --> 00:23:57,214
- Many of us had assumed--
- Many of us, you say?

344
00:23:57,297 --> 00:23:58,924
Have your bannermen
questioned my choice of heir?

345
00:23:59,008 --> 00:24:00,217
Of course not, Your Grace.

346
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,304
It is your sworn duty
to report rebellion

347
00:24:03,387 --> 00:24:05,556
- stirring in my kingdom.
- Rebellion?

348
00:24:05,639 --> 00:24:07,391
There's been nothing of the
sort, Your Grace. I, I--

349
00:24:07,474 --> 00:24:13,522
I did not decide to name
Rhaenyra my heir on a whim.

350
00:24:13,605 --> 00:24:17,276
All the lords of the kingdom
would do well to remember that.

351
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:23,157
Thank you... for the gift.

352
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:27,453

Otto Hightower: The huntsman
has the trail, Your Grace,

357
00:24:48,223 --> 00:24:49,767
and has sent out the hounds.

358
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:52,102
It won't be long now until
the white hart is cornered.

359
00:24:52,186 --> 00:24:54,855
Your prize is within reach.

360
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:00,402
What do you make of
Lord Jason's proposal?

361

That man's pride has pride.

362
00:25:05,616 --> 00:25:10,788
You're not only Rhaenyra's
father, you're the King.

363
00:25:10,871 --> 00:25:12,289
She'll do as you command.

364
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:17,294
It is not my wish to command her, Otto.

365
00:25:17,377 --> 00:25:19,505
I want her to be happy.

366
00:25:24,384 --> 00:25:28,514
There is another choice
beyond Casterly Rock.

367
00:25:28,597 --> 00:25:32,768
One, perhaps,
you might be more comfortable with.

368
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:36,146
One... closer to home.

369
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,356
Who do you have in mind?

370

The boy just turned two, Otto.

373
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:57,876
Yes, but it would cease the endless
proposals for Rhaenyra's hand.

Ser Criston went after her,

Ser Harwin "Breakbones,"

401
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:05,796
the strongest knight
in the Seven Kingdoms,

402
00:28:05,879 --> 00:28:08,257
is the best match for Rhaenyra.

403
00:28:09,925 --> 00:28:12,010
You flatter me, Your Grace, but no.

404
00:28:12,094 --> 00:28:16,932
It would seem to me the best match for
Rhaenyra is the son of The Sea Snake,

405
00:28:17,015 --> 00:28:19,393
Ser Laenor.

406
00:28:19,476 --> 00:28:22,562
Some years ago, I counseled
you to take his sister to wife.

407
00:28:22,646 --> 00:28:25,482
My reasoning remains the same.

408
00:28:25,565 --> 00:28:28,986
Laenor is of pure Valyrian descent.

409
00:28:29,069 --> 00:28:32,614
He shares blood with your
cousin, the Princess Rhaenys.

410
00:28:32,698 --> 00:28:35,951
And he is the heir to the
wealthiest house in the realm.

411
00:28:37,119 --> 00:28:37,995
The breach between your houses

412

has not narrowed since
I last spoke of it.

or imagined.

I rather prefer it here.

His Grace is certain to be
worried by your absence.

His Grace can worry
himself to death if he so likes.

Tell me something, Ser Criston.

- How fared my grandson?

508
00:40:02,971 --> 00:40:05,682
The ladies Lannister and Redwyne
were quite taken with him.

Otto: As they should be.

He's the future of the realm.

511
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:15,149
Well, you yourself witnessed
the scale of the celebration,

512
00:40:15,233 --> 00:40:17,652
how it's united the men.

513
00:40:17,735 --> 00:40:19,070
When you bore the King a son,

514
00:40:19,153 --> 00:40:22,281
you ended 15 years
of uncertainty and doubt.

515
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:24,784
Aegon, like his namesake,

516
00:40:24,867 --> 00:40:27,829
was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms.

517
00:40:27,912 --> 00:40:29,622
If Viserys were to name him heir,

518
00:40:29,706 --> 00:40:31,833
the realm would fete him for it.

519
00:40:37,797 --> 00:40:39,924
And does this not please you?

520
00:40:40,008 --> 00:40:44,470
- Do you not want your son to be King?
- And what mother wouldn't?

521
00:40:44,554 --> 00:40:45,847
You mustn't ignore the certain truth

522
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:49,809
that if Rhaenyra were to step
over Aegon to ascend the throne,

523
00:40:49,892 --> 00:40:52,061
the realm would tear itself apart.

524
00:40:54,147 --> 00:40:57,358
They all swore obeisance to her,
our house among them.

525
00:40:57,442 --> 00:40:59,277
That was before Aegon.

526
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,988
Rhaenyra will be a good queen.

527
00:41:02,071 --> 00:41:07,035
It wouldn't matter if she were
Jaehaerys himself born again.

528
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:11,539
- Rhaenyra is a woman.
- What of my son?

529
00:41:11,622 --> 00:41:14,584
Would you have me raise a man to
steal his own sister's birthright?

530
00:41:14,667 --> 00:41:17,587
It is Aegon that's being robbed.

531
00:41:17,670 --> 00:41:19,630
He's the firstborn son of the King.

532
00:41:19,714 --> 00:41:21,841
To deny that he is heir to the throne

533
00:41:21,924 --> 00:41:23,468
is to assail the laws of gods and men.

534
00:41:25,553 --> 00:41:30,433
The road ahead is uncertain,
but the end is clear.

535
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:32,351
Aegon will be king.

536
00:41:34,145 --> 00:41:36,397
You must guide Viserys towards reason.

537
00:41:39,692 --> 00:41:41,569
He'll never find it on his own.

538
00:41:49,619 --> 00:41:50,578
How are you feeling, husband?

539
00:41:50,661 --> 00:41:53,331
The gods have punished me
for my indulgences.

540
00:41:53,414 --> 00:41:55,666
- (door closes)
- At least the wine was good.

541
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,794
Too good.

542
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:03,216
(King Viserys sighing)

543
00:42:09,263 --> 00:42:11,516
I was hoping we might
discuss something.

544
00:42:15,478 --> 00:42:16,687
Rhaenyra?

545
00:42:18,898 --> 00:42:20,691
(sighs)

546
00:42:20,775 --> 00:42:22,318
I do not think she enjoyed
Jason Lannister's company.

547
00:42:24,529 --> 00:42:26,739
She is cross.

548
00:42:26,823 --> 00:42:28,658
I warned you that she would be.

549
00:42:28,741 --> 00:42:30,701
Rhaenyra has come of age.

550
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:32,161
She must needs marry a high lord

551
00:42:32,245 --> 00:42:33,621
who will honor her, defend her,

552
00:42:33,704 --> 00:42:36,165
and serve her as king consort.

553
00:42:36,249 --> 00:42:38,960
Her wishes in this matter
are irrelevant.

554
00:42:39,043 --> 00:42:42,672
I do believe that Rhaenyra
will marry, Your Grace.

555
00:42:42,755 --> 00:42:45,925
But she must believe
it is her choice to do so.

556
00:42:46,843 --> 00:42:48,928
(sighs)

557
00:42:54,475 --> 00:42:56,853
- What's this?
- A letter...

558
00:42:58,104 --> 00:43:01,232
from Vaemond Velaryon.

559
00:43:01,315 --> 00:43:04,861
- The Sea Snake's brother.
- Yeah.

560
00:43:04,944 --> 00:43:07,238
He's fighting in the Stepstones,

561
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,990
with all the rest of them.

562
00:43:13,786 --> 00:43:15,371
May I?

563
00:43:26,507 --> 00:43:29,677
Lord Corlys and Prince Daemon
are losing their war.

564
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,846
Badly, by all accounts.

565
00:43:32,722 --> 00:43:34,557
This is a plea for aid.

566
00:43:36,225 --> 00:43:39,145
Then why not send it?

567
00:43:39,228 --> 00:43:42,273
Because it is a war
started by two malcontents,

568
00:43:42,356 --> 00:43:44,483
unhappy with decisions I made.

569
00:43:46,027 --> 00:43:48,279
If I now provide
Daemon and Corlys succor,

570
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:50,615
what will that say of their king?

571
00:43:50,698 --> 00:43:53,409
Perhaps, that he is a good
man who loves his brother.

572
00:43:53,492 --> 00:43:56,913
Well, if you truly
believe that, my dear...

573
00:43:56,996 --> 00:43:59,207
then you possess a generous spirit.

574
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:03,085
What do you believe, Viserys?

575
00:44:05,505 --> 00:44:08,507
That I am forever doomed
to anger one person

576
00:44:08,591 --> 00:44:10,927
in the pleasing of another.

577
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,930
Then I pose a simpler question.

578
00:44:14,013 --> 00:44:16,974
Is it better for the realm
if the Crabfeeder thrives,

579
00:44:17,058 --> 00:44:18,684
or is vanquished?

580
00:44:21,103 --> 00:44:23,147
(door opens)

581
00:44:24,649 --> 00:44:27,443
King Viserys: Make haste to
Dwarfstone, Ser Addam.

582
00:44:27,526 --> 00:44:29,111
Hand-deliver this
to Prince Daemon yourself.

583
00:44:29,195 --> 00:44:31,530
At once, Your Grace.

584
00:44:40,206 --> 00:44:43,501
- Dwarfstone?
- I'm sending word to Daemon.

585
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:47,004
Aid is sailing to the Stepstones.

586
00:44:47,088 --> 00:44:50,883
- Did he make call for help?
- He would sooner die.

587
00:44:50,967 --> 00:44:53,261
But his king does not
mean to allow that.

588
00:44:57,807 --> 00:45:00,101
Do you not think my decision correct?

589
00:45:00,184 --> 00:45:02,645
It is no consequence to what I think...

590
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:04,522
as I'm often reminded.

591
00:45:07,149 --> 00:45:09,527
Daemon is thorn enough in my flesh.

592
00:45:09,610 --> 00:45:11,487
Will you insist on taking after him?

593
00:45:13,781 --> 00:45:15,449
Must everything be a battle?

594
00:45:15,533 --> 00:45:18,911
If you refer to your attempt to
marry me off to Casterly Rock.

595
00:45:18,995 --> 00:45:21,914
(sighs) I am sorry, Rhaenyra.

596
00:45:23,124 --> 00:45:25,334
I was trying to help you.

597
00:45:25,418 --> 00:45:27,670
Will you not be helped?

598
00:45:27,753 --> 00:45:31,215
Why must every effort
on your behalf be resisted

599
00:45:31,299 --> 00:45:35,136
- as if to the death?
- Because you mean to replace me...

600
00:45:35,219 --> 00:45:37,346
with Alicent Hightower's son,

601
00:45:37,430 --> 00:45:40,433
the boy you always wanted.

602
00:45:40,516 --> 00:45:41,726
You have him in hands now.

603
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:44,854
Y-You have no further use for me.

604
00:45:44,937 --> 00:45:47,356
You might as well peddle me
for what you can.

605
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:50,943
A mountain stronghold
or a fleet of ships.

606
00:45:51,027 --> 00:45:52,987
You have misjudged me, Rhaenyra.

607
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,947
All know it.

608
00:45:55,031 --> 00:45:56,198
Jason Lannister knows it.

609
00:45:56,282 --> 00:45:58,701
You said it yourself,

610
00:45:58,784 --> 00:46:01,537
the lords of the realm gather
like vultures to a carcass,

611
00:46:01,621 --> 00:46:03,581
hoping to feast on my bones.

612
00:46:06,459 --> 00:46:10,379
It is true that as rulers
we must marry for advantage

613
00:46:10,463 --> 00:46:13,424
to forge alliances
and bolster our strength.

614
00:46:13,507 --> 00:46:16,552
You have always understood this.

615
00:46:16,635 --> 00:46:18,220
I myself was promised
to your mother when I was--

616
00:46:18,304 --> 00:46:20,848
Ten-and-seven years of age.

617
00:46:20,931 --> 00:46:22,933
The Vale had an army
to rival the North.

618
00:46:23,017 --> 00:46:24,769
I've heard that story
since I've had ears to.

619
00:46:26,979 --> 00:46:29,398
I loved her.

620
00:46:29,482 --> 00:46:30,941
She made a man of me.

621
00:46:34,528 --> 00:46:36,864
I do not seek to replace you, child.

622
00:46:37,948 --> 00:46:40,868
You've been much alone
these last few years.

623
00:46:40,951 --> 00:46:42,745
Alone and angry.

624
00:46:44,288 --> 00:46:46,123
I will not live forever.

625
00:46:46,207 --> 00:46:48,084
I wish to see you contented,

626
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:49,752
happy even.

627
00:46:49,835 --> 00:46:51,128
You think a man will do it?

628
00:46:51,212 --> 00:46:52,296
- A family.
- I had a family.

629
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,715
What would you have me do?!

630
00:46:54,799 --> 00:46:57,676
If it was for advantage,
you would've wed Laena Velaryon!

631
00:47:02,848 --> 00:47:04,475
That is true enough.

632
00:47:06,227 --> 00:47:09,939
You must marry,

633
00:47:10,022 --> 00:47:12,566
strengthen your own claim,

634
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:13,984

perhaps 18, seaworthy ships.

652
00:48:48,829 --> 00:48:52,041
Seven hundred foot, some 60 knights.

653
00:48:52,124 --> 00:48:55,753
Our food quickly dwindles,
save for what we can fish from the sea.

654
00:48:55,836 --> 00:48:57,254
I would say we have a fortnight,

655
00:48:57,338 --> 00:48:59,924
mayhaps a bit longer
with strict rationing.

656
00:49:00,007 --> 00:49:02,176
I've made call for Driftmark
to send more ships,

657
00:49:02,259 --> 00:49:03,928
but they will be weeks away.

658
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:07,681
We are faltering
and the Triarchy knows it.

659
00:49:07,765 --> 00:49:11,227
We must press the attack,
continue sending the dragons.

Laenor Velaryon:
It's pointless, father.

661
00:49:12,978 --> 00:49:15,397
The Crabfeeder has
created a chokepoint here,

663
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:19,944
Archers hold the high positions,

664
00:49:20,027 --> 00:49:21,737
foot soldiers hold the ground.

665
00:49:21,820 --> 00:49:23,822
We've strafed them on
dragonback again and again,

666
00:49:23,906 --> 00:49:26,033
but they just retreat within the caves.

Dragons can circle Bloodstone

The Crabfeeder and his men

have no reason to leave those caves.

Laenor:
We must give them one,

671
00:49:35,292 --> 00:49:37,253
