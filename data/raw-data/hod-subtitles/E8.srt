Princess Rhaenys:
It's been near six years

5
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,822
since I last saw
my lord husband, Maester.

6

sailors into an ambush.

A ship made to look
as if it were abandoned.

9
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,712
In the fighting, his neck was
slashed by a corsair's dagger.

10
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,340
He fell overboard into the sea.

11

The wound was severe.

12
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,094
Much blood was lost.

13
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,055
But the greater concern
is the fever that followed.

So they arrive in three days.

Let all be made ready

No doubt.

And yet, I have seen blood
fever overcome men half his age.

23
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,643
I will not suffer the talk of
crows in my house, Vaemond.

I love my brother...

By a man whose ambition

has brought down on us
calamity after calamity.

42

My brother cares only

requires your attention.

164
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,833
Whatever it is, Ser Arryk,
it'll need to wait.

165
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:16,712
- I'm Erryk, Your Grace.
- Of course. My apologies, ser.

166
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,464
It's about the Prince.

167
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:21,550
There's been a delicate
situation in his apartments.

168
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:27,890
(unsettling music playing)

169
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,959

(melancholy music playing)

173
00:14:18,857 --> 00:14:22,570
- Who goes there?
- Rhaenyra: Father.

174
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,407
It's me, my King.

175
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,244
Rhaenyra.

176
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:31,870
King Viserys:
Oh...

177
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,373
Oh.

178
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,211
I'm here with Daemon.

179

Daemon?

181
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:46,677
(exhales) Daemon.

182
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,887
(Viserys wheezes)

183
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,307
Help me up.

(groaning)

185
00:14:57,646 --> 00:14:59,732
Oh...

186
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,899
(labored breathing)

187
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,449
(exhales)

188
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:09,867
It has been so long.

189
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:20,210
The Sea Snake has taken a grave
wound in battle in the Stepstones.

190
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,504
When?

191
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:25,049
We won that war years ago.

192
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,925
No.

193
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:30,304
The Triarchy is resurgent.

194
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,349
The fighting is anew.

195
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:38,187
And there is a p-- There is a petition to
decide upon the succession of Driftmark

196
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,314
and the heir to the Driftwood Throne.

(Viserys sighs)

198
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,110
Viserys: Petitions?

199
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:51,200
Alicent and Otto...
they see to all that business now.

200
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:54,036
No, brother, listen to me.

201
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,539
You are to affirm
your position for Lucerys

202
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,208
to be Corlys Velaryon's successor.

203
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,960
(door opens)

204
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:05,172
Has something happened to Lord Corlys?

205
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:06,799
(baby babbling)

206
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,717
Father...

207
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,762
there's someone we wish
to introduce you to.

208
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,892

Daemon.

212
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:35,411
- Brother.
- (baby babbles)

213
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,122
Who is that?

214
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,750
Rhaenyra: Father...

215
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,546
this is Aegon.

216
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:47,589
Aegon. (exhales)

217
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:51,552
And this... is Viserys.

218
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:55,973
Ah... Viserys.

219
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,144
Oh.

220
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:04,732
(laughs) Now that is
a name fit for a king.

221
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,400
(laughing)

222
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,154
Oh...

223
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,451
Oh, oh...

224
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:16,785
Oh, I'm sorry.

225
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:20,622
Oh, I'm sorry. I-I'm sorry.

226
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,667
- (children crying)
- I'm so--

227
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,672
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sor--

228
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:29,965
Please.

229
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,300
(mouthing)

230
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,970
- My tea... My tea.
- What tea? This?

231
00:17:35,053 --> 00:17:37,473
Yes. Yes.

232
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,058
Yes.

233
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,103
(children crying)

234
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,567
(groans)

235
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,487
(breathing heavily)

236
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,996
(Viserys sighs)

237
00:18:01,079 --> 00:18:02,122
(servant crying)

238
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:11,381
Talya:
I brought her here immediately.

239
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:13,383
She's seen no one else, Your Grace.

240
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,307
- Come here, sweetling.
- (crying)

241
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,726
(door closes)

242
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,109
Tell me your name.

243
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:40,035
It's Dyana, Your Grace.
If... i-if it please you.

244
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,040
Dyana.
What a pretty name.

245
00:18:48,126 --> 00:18:50,128
I understand you've found
yourself in some trouble.

246
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,676
I was fetching the Prince his wine,

247
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,721
and I put it on his table,
and when I turned--

248
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,140
I didn't see him.

249
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,560
I asked him to stop, Your Grace.

250
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,313
I did, truly...

251
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,399
you must believe me.

252
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:13,527
(crying breaths)

253
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,576
Shh.

254
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,164
Thank you for telling me, Dyana.

255
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,672
- I know it wasn't your fault.
- Hm?

256
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,634
I believe you.

257
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,303
Y-You do?

258
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:41,763
I do.

259
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,894
But what I worry about...

260
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,138
is what others might believe.

261
00:19:51,189 --> 00:19:54,484
You were alone with the Prince,
were you not?

262
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,737
Yes, I-- (stammers)

263
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,407
And no one else saw what
happened between the two of you.

264
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:02,618
If anyone else were
to hear about this--

265
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:07,789
- I haven't told anyone.
- You told Ser Erryk and Talya and now me.

266
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,183
And though I believe
you are not to blame,

267
00:20:09,207 --> 00:20:12,586
others might not be so trusting.

268
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,632
They might think you were trying
to besmirch the Prince, or worse...

269
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,715
that you're the sort of girl that might
have enticed him in the first place.

270
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,513
And you know what happens
to girls like that.

271
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:29,227
I, I wouldn't dream of breathing
another word to anyone, Your Grace.

272
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,689
I, I swear it on my life.

273
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:35,734
(shuddering breaths)

274
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,407
I know you won't.

275
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,838
For your troubles.

276
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,676
(door opens, closes)

277
00:21:04,429 --> 00:21:06,264
The tea, Your Grace.

278
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:22,114
It's best to be certain.

279
00:21:41,341 --> 00:21:42,426
(Dyana gulps)

280
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:51,393
Queen Alicent:
Get up.

281
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,103
(shouts) Aegon!

282
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,065
(yells) Get up!

283
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:01,611
(sighs) Mother?

284
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:06,783
- What is it?
- "What is it? What is it?

285
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,761
What is it?"
That's all you can say for yourself?

286
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,038
Has something happened?

287
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,749
- Dyana.
- Mm?

288
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:16,043
Alicent:
The serving girl.

289
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:19,212
- (exhales)
- Oh, for the gods' sake.

290
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,649
The girl, Aegon. The one you
sent fleeing from your company.

291
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,259
Prince Aegon: (stretching)
Oh, it was just harmless fun.

292
00:22:24,342 --> 00:22:27,929
She didn't need to go
and get upset about it.

293
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:32,142
Think of the shame on your wife, on me.

294
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,603
How can you keep carrying on like this,

295
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,605
especially on a day like today?

296
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:39,691
Why? What is it today?

297
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,740
(sniffles)

298
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,915
You are no son of mine.

299
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,297
I did not ask for this.

300
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:05,258
I've done everything
you've asked me to,

301
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,469
and I try so...

302
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,889
I try so hard, but it will never
be enough for you or father.

303
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,141
(door opens)

304
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:17,187
Have you seen Dyana?
She's supposed to dress the children.

305
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:26,613
He looks like a different person.

306
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:31,118
I believe we should also
consult Maester Gerardys.

307
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:33,995
Perhaps if he could see the
King, he'd suggest a different--

308
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,081
Princess Rhaenyra.

309
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:37,833
- And Prince Daemon.
- Daemon: Hm.

310
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:43,630
It has been so long since we were
granted the joy of your presence.

311
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,093
Indeed, Your Grace.

312
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:51,513
Though not long enough to merit
a greeting upon our arrival.

313
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:54,516
I'm sure the Queen had
pressing business, my love.

314
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,936
What can either of us
know of ruling a kingdom?

315
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,813
I do not rule, as you well know.

316
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:02,524
My father and I are mere stewards
of the King's will and wisdom.

317
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:05,652
Daemon: And how exactly is
that wisdom expressed...

318
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,028
hm?

319
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,073
In blinks and wheezes?

320
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,843
I'd be surprised if he
could remember his own name.

321
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,702
- Or if you could.
- King Viserys's condition

322
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,288
- has worsened since you saw him last.
- Hah.

323
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,082
It subjects him to considerable pain.

324
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,626
- On the advice of the maesters--
- Ah, the maesters.

325
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:25,172
Of course.
It is they who keep him...

326
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:26,423
addled on milk of the poppy

327
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,050
while the Hightowers warm his throne.

328
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,052
Rhaenyra, if you would
see him without it,

329
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,447
- almost blind with suffering.
- Oh, Alicent, I have no doubt

330
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:36,683
it was... an act
of the purest mercy,

331
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:39,186
but tell me, for the King's suffering,

332
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,604
did the maesters also prescribe

333
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:42,397
the removal of Targaryen heraldry

334
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:46,151
and the installation in its stead
of various statues and stars?

335
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:48,671
The emblems of the Seven serve only
to guide us on an uncertain path.

336
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:52,407
- To remind us of a higher authority.
- And on the morrow,

337
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,995
which authority will sit in judgment of
my son's claim on his own inheritance?

338
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,748
- That would be mine... and the Hand's.
- Daemon: Ah.

339
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,791
But be assured,
the Father is just and commands me

340
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,128
to forget the accusations you
have hurled in this room today.

341
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,218
(swords clashing)

342
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:14,846
- Smaller than I remember.
- It looks exactly the same.

343
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,891
- Ah, Luke, come on.
- (knights, squires grunting)

344
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,568
(indistinct chatter)

345
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:34,616
See? I told you this
would still be here.

346
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,869
And you thought you could
swing Criston's morningstar.

347
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,871
And you almost took your own head off.

348
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:48,171
- What's your problem?
- Everyone's staring at us.

349
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,297
Hyah!

350
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,549
No one would question me
being heir to Driftmark...

351
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:57,138
if...

352
00:25:57,222 --> 00:26:00,517
if I looked more like Ser Laenor
Velaryon than Ser Harwin Strong.

353
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,938
It doesn't matter what they think.

354
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:10,318
- (crowd cheering)
- (distant grunting)

355
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,285
(grunting)

356
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,079
- (crowd gasps)
- Ooh.

357
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,966
(sword whooshes)

358
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,345
(yelling)

359
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,686
(crowd applauds)

360
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:51,318
Well done, my Prince.

361
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:52,753
You'll be winning tourneys in no time.

362
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,946
I don't give a shit about tourneys.

363
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,823
Nephews...

364
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:00,535
have you come to train?

365
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:01,995
Guard: (shouts)
Open the gate!

366
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,122
(gate opening)

367
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:16,426
(intense music playing)

368
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:17,594
(footsteps marching)

369
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,739
Otto Hightower:
Hold your nerve, my Queen.

370
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,367
What we do,
we do for the good of the realm.

371
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:45,163
I must confess a certain
uneasiness now this is at hand.

372
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:49,501
- He may yet live.
- But we must be prepared if he does not.

373
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,761
The realm has enjoyed a long peace,

374
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,764
a credit to the work of
both Jaehaerys and Viserys,

375
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:07,435
but the threat of war looms
and may arrive on our shores.

376
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,480
When it does,
will you want a child at the command

377
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:12,774
of the greatest fleet in Westeros?

378
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,693
We must, of course...

379
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,781
act in the interest of our subjects.

380
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:25,495
The next Lord of the Tides will be
deeply in your debt, Your Grace.

381
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,747
As will Driftmark...

382
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:29,874
in all its strength.

383
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,669
(bell tolling)

384
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,675
(thundering)

385
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,726
Rhaena Targaryen:
Grandmother?

386
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:55,567
Rhaena.

387
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,782
Baela said you might be here.

388
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:07,120
She's done well as your ward.

389
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:08,496
You've, um...

390
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:10,331
raised her admirably.

391
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:14,669
You honor me, Princess.

392
00:29:14,752 --> 00:29:17,505
Might I speak to the Princess
alone, Rhaena?

393
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,885
Princess.

394
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,521
I wondered for many an hour

395
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:37,233
what your purpose was in coming here.

396
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:40,361
Whether you'd speak for or against
the suit brought by Ser Vaemond.

397
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:43,281
But then, I realized...

398
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,283
you intend to advocate for yourself.

399
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,206
This is no fair proceeding.

400
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:53,374
It is a trap

401
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,376
set by the Queen and the Hand,
I'd wager,

402
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,253
to proclaim my son illegitimate.

403
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,298
Yet you did worse
than that with Laenor.

404
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,635
Did you not?

405
00:30:09,974 --> 00:30:11,643
I loved your son.

406
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:16,898
You may not believe it
to be true, but I did.

407
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,779
I did not order his death.

408
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:28,243
Nor was I complicit in it.
I swear this to you.

409
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,126
I'll make you an offer.

410
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,798
Back Luke's claim,

411
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:44,634
and let us betroth
Laena's children to mine.

412
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:51,182
Baela will be Queen
of the Seven Kingdoms

413
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,935
and her sons will be
heirs to the throne.

414
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:56,104
Rhaena will rule in Driftmark, and...

415
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:59,357
the seat will pass to her and
Lucerys's children in time.

416
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,943
A generous offer.

417
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:03,945
(thunder rumbling)

418
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,948
- Or a desperate one.
- What does it matter?

419
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,618
(soft chuckle)

420
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:13,580
You are right in this, at least.

421
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,210
It does not matter.

422
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,720
♪ ♪

423
00:31:28,803 --> 00:31:31,973
You can bargain with me all you like.

424
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:35,602
Bring my granddaughter
with you to soften my resolve.

425
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:39,897
But tomorrow,
the Hightowers land their first blow.

426
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,402
They force you to your knees...

427
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,322
and I must stand alone.

428
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,826
(tense music playing)

429
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:02,629
(exhales)

430
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,843
(thundering, rain falling)

431
00:32:11,304 --> 00:32:13,014
(lightning cracks)

432
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,978
(Viserys breathing heavily)

433
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,784
(softly) Alicent?

434
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,036
Alicent...

435
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,080
No, it's Rhaenyra, father.

436
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:40,291
(breathing heavily)

437
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:43,294
Rhaenyra.

438
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:45,338
(muttering)

439
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,548
(thunder rumbling)

440
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:52,345
"The Song of Ice and Fire."
Do you believe it to be true?

441
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,933
Aegon's Dream.

442
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,522
You told me

443
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:06,609
it was our duty to hold the realm
united against a common foe.

444
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:13,700
By naming me heir,
you divided the realm.

445
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,289
(Viserys breathing heavily)

446
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:24,919
I thought I wanted it.

447
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,974
But the burden is a heavy one.

448
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,603
(softly)
It's too heavy.

449
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,320
My...

450
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:54,073
My only child.

451
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:02,248
If you wish me to bear it,
then defend me.

452
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,293
And my children.

453
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,669
(sighs)

454
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:12,258
(quietly) It's...

455
00:34:14,051 --> 00:34:16,637
(thundering)

456
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:23,019
(Viserys murmurs)

457
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,902
(Rhaenyra sniffles)

458
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,196
(crying)

459
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:37,992
(bells tolling)

460
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:43,289
(birds chirping)

461
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:47,085
(breathing heavily)

462
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,231
I want to have supper, Otto.

463
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:15,238
- It is the morning, Your Grace.
- Tonight.

464
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:20,868
The whole of my family...

465
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,112
are gathered at the Red Keep.

466
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:28,960
I want us... to dine together.

467
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,757
(groaning)

468
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:44,141
(groaning)

469
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,065
(groaning continues)

470
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:01,951
Bring milk of the poppy.

471
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,872
(breathing heavily)

472
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:17,383
(quietly) No.

473
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,513
Just arrange the supper.

474
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,768
(indistinct chatter)

475
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,687
Though it is the great
hope of this court

476
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:34,108
that Lord Corlys Velaryon
survive his wounds,

477
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,611
we gather here with the grim task

478
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,155
of dealing with
the succession of Driftmark.

479
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,783
As Hand, I speak with
the King's voice on this

480
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,202
and all other matters.

481
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,582
The crown will now hear the petitions.

482
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,710
Ser Vaemond of House Velaryon.

483
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,637
Vaemond: My Queen.

484
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,764
My Lord Hand.

485
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,350
The history of our noble houses

486
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,018
extends beyond the Seven Kingdoms

487
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,270
to the days of Old Valyria.

488
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:14,190
For as long as House
Targaryen has ruled the skies,

489
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,859
House Velaryon has ruled the seas.

490
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,945
When the Doom fell on Valyria,

491
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:21,572
our houses became
the last of their kind.

492
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,050
Our forebearers came to this new land,

493
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:24,992
knowing that were they to fail,

494
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:29,622
it would mean the end to their
bloodlines and their name.

495
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:33,501
I have spent my entire life on
Driftmark defending my brother's seat.

496
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,338
I am Lord Corlys's closest kin,
his own blood.

497
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:41,467
The true, unimpeachable blood of
House Velaryon runs through my veins.

498
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:45,513
As it does in my sons,
the offspring of Laenor Velaryon.

499
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:48,349
If you cared so much about your
house's blood, Ser Vaemond,

500
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,810
you would not be so bold as
to supplant its rightful heir.

501
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,645
No, you only speak for yourself

502
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,498
- and for your own ambition.
- You will have chance

503
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,732
to make your own petition,
Princess Rhaenyra.

504
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,402
Do Ser Vaemond the courtesy
of allowing his to be heard.

505
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:08,035
What do you know of Velaryon
blood, Princess?

506
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:12,373
I could cut my veins and show it to you

507
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,584
and you still wouldn't recognize it.

508
00:38:15,668 --> 00:38:19,714
This is about the future and
survival of my house, not yours.

509
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:27,054
My Queen, my Lord Hand.

510
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:32,518
This is a matter of blood,
not ambition.

511
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:36,397
I place the continuation of the survival
of my house and my line above all.

512
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:41,652
I humbly put myself before you
as my brother's successor...

513
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:45,239
the Lord of Driftmark
and Lord of the Tides.

514
00:38:46,407 --> 00:38:48,034
Thank you, Ser Vaemond.

515
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:57,960
Princess Rhaenyra, you may now speak

516

You... may run your house
