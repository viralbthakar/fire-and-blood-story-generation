00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,424
Ser Ryam was a strong Lord Commander

3
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:15,051
of the Kingsguard.

4
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,304
But he was ill for some time.

5
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,014
He passed in peace, I hope.

6
00:02:20,098 --> 00:02:21,057
Yes, Your Grace.

7
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,391
He was found to have passed

8
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,310
gently in his sleep.

9
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,730
His remains are being prepared
by the Silent Sisters.

10
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:31,150
The succeeding Lord Commander,
Ser Harrold,

11
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:35,529
would like to make haste in finding
Ser Ryam's replacement on the Kingsguard.

12
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:37,615
Your Grace. My lords.

13
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:41,161
The Kingsguard must soon be restored
to its full complement of seven.

14
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:43,996
With the help of the Hand,

15
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:46,582
I've invited a number of
fine candidates to court.

16
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:48,543
All have passed fair trials.

17
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,715
Four ships have now been lost.

18
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,134
The last one was flying my banner.

19
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,136
The Stepstones have now
grown into a conflagration,

20
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,680
yet you sit here
and dither about court business.

21
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,933
If you've something
to discuss, Lord Corlys--

22
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:05,810
I want to know what is to be done

23
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:07,978
about my ships and my men.

24
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,271
The Crown will compensate you

25
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,482
for your ship and crew,
and make an offering

26
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,652
- to the men's families.
- I don't want compensation.

27
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:19,156
I want to seize the Stepstones by force

28
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,699
and burn out this Crabfeeder.

29
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,702
I am not prepared to start
a war with the Free Cities.

30
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,497
These pirates are not the Free Cities.

31
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,667
Who do you think provides them
with their ships and tender?

32
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:31,961
In all of its history, my lord,

33
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:33,921
the Seven Kingdoms have never entered

34
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,714
open war with the Free Cities.

35
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:37,424
Were that to happen,

36
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:40,303
the losses would be incalculable.

37
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,226
What reason does
the Crabfeeder have to fear us?

38
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:52,398
The King's own brother has been allowed
to seize Dragonstone

39
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:55,484
and fortify it with an army
of his gold cloaks.

40
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,153
Daemon has squatted there
for over half a year

41
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,197
without even a protest from The Crown.

42
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:03,075
I'll caution you, Lord Corlys,

43
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,663
a seat at the King's table
does not make you his equal.

44
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,584
I have acted, Corlys.

45
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,921
I've sent envoys to Pentos and Volantis

46
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,840
to see if we might find common cause.

47
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,010
Ships and men are at the ready.

48
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:25,223
The Stepstones will be settled in time.

49
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,101
You have dragonriders, father.

50
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:35,733
Send us.

51
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:43,908
It isn't that simple, Rhaenyra.

52
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,535
It would be a show of force.

53
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,121
At least the Princess has a plan.

54
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,501
- I only meant that we should at least--
- Perhaps,

55
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:58,756
there's some better use
for the Princess's talents, Your Grace.

56
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,719
Why don't you take the Princess
to see about the new

57
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,430
Kingsguard posting, Lord Commander?

58
00:05:07,306 --> 00:05:08,766
A fine idea, Your Grace.

59
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:13,437
This knight will protect you as well.

60
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,064
You should choose.

61
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,753
Ser Desmond Caron,

62
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,130
a fine knight, Princess.

63
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,133
Step forward, Ser Desmond.

64
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,136
Son of Ser Royce Caron,

65
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:48,764
Ser Desmond has proved strong and steady

66
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:51,767
in both the tourney lists and without.

67
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,687
While traveling through the Kingswood
on his way to King's Landing,

68
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,731
Ser Desmond recently brought
a would-be poacher

69
00:05:57,732 --> 00:05:58,941
to justice.

70
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:13,205
You might thank him
for his leal service, Princess.

71
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:16,417
We thank you for your loyal
service to The Crown, ser.

72
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,014
Ser Rymun Mallister.

73
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:35,352
Son of Lord Lymond Mallister of Seagard.

74
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,480
Winner of the melee at Cider Hall.

75
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,774
He was the last mounted
of three-and-twenty knights.

76
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:42,901
Ser Rymun was knighted at eight-and-ten.

77
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:45,071
Do any of these knights
have combat experience?

78
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,241
Beyond capturing poachers.

79
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,376
Ser Criston Cole.

80
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:07,343
Son of the steward
of the Lord of Blackhaven.

81
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,305
Be welcome, Ser Criston.

82
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,893
You saw combat in the Stormlands.

83
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,145
Dornish marches, Princess.

84
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:21,357
I fought for a year as a foot soldier
against the Dornish incursions.

85
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,443
Ser Arlan Dondarrion
knighted me after we razed

86
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:26,445
two of the watchtowers along the Boneway.

87
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,828
I choose Ser Criston Cole.

88
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,415
Let's not be too hasty, Princess.

89
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:41,710
There's no doubt Ser Criston
is a fine warrior,

90
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,254
but houses such as Crakehall and Mallister

91
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,924
are important allies of The Crown.

92
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,718
Seagard, for instance,
is the realm's prime defense

93
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:51,470
against reavers from the Iron Islands.

94
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,097
Those men are tourney knights.

95
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,975
My father should be defended by a man
who's known real combat.

96
00:07:58,811 --> 00:07:59,937
Should he not?

97
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,066
Of course, Princess.

98
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,694
Well, let us plan Ser Criston's
investiture then.

99
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,122
The Valyrian capital
was built into a volcano,

100
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,707
much like Dragonstone.

101
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,794
And the dragonlords,
the highest of the nobility,

102
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,797
lived here, at the volcanic face,

103
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:30,050
closest to the source
of their magic and power.

104
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,928
And this was the Anogrion.

105
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,224
Where the bloodmages worked their craft.

106
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,103
It is truly wondrous what you've built.

107
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,146
Oh no.

108
00:08:43,522 --> 00:08:47,067
I only pore over the histories
and provide the plans.

109
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:49,445
The stonemasons built the structures.

110
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,823
Do you believe that Westeros
can be another Valyria, Your Grace?

111
00:08:52,907 --> 00:08:55,075
That depends,
whether you speak of the Freehold

112
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,078
at its height or at its fall.

113
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,247
Over a thousand dragons,

114
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:03,251
a navy large enough to span
the seas of the world.

115
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:09,423
The glory of Old Valyria
will never be seen again.

116
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,218
Seven Hells.

117
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,860
Tell me, how is Rhaenyra?

118
00:09:30,569 --> 00:09:32,237
- What do you mean?
- Well, these days,

119
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,657
she doesn't say more
than a few words to me.

120
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,243
I think she might find it difficult

121
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,538
to discuss personal matters.

122
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,499
It will take time.

123
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:47,545
It did when I lost mine own mother.

124
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,845
I wish she would approach me.

125
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:58,764
What if you went to her?

126
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,558
There are times when I would rather face

127
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:04,687
the Black Dread himself
than mine own daughter of 15.

128
00:10:07,857 --> 00:10:10,776
I think she would open
herself to you if invited.

129
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:15,156
You do have such an easy way about you,
Your Grace.

130
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:22,288
You do not mention our talks to Rhaenyra,
do you?

131
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:25,875
I just,

132
00:10:27,293 --> 00:10:29,378
I fear that she wouldn't understand them.

133
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,714
No, Your Grace.

134
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:48,021
It's only been half a year
since my mother died,

135
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,107
and already they tried
to marry my father off

136
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,359
and replace me as heir.

137
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,486
I know those men and how they plot

138
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,781
in their secret councils
when I've been sent away.

139
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,410
You cannot worry at the matters
of lords and kings, Rhaenyra.

140
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,414
What if your father were to remarry?

141
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,050
Your father loves you.

142
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,141
He chose you for his heir.

143
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,895
He didn't choose me. He spurns Daemon.

144
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,081
Kneel with me.

145
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,767
I find this is a way to be with my mother.

146
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,479
Here in the quiet of the Sept,

147
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,482
I feel close to her.

148
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:22,408
- I know it sounds foolish.
- I don't think it's foolish.

149
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,578
- I don't.
- Good.

150
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,000
Because I thought you might try.

151
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,882
If not for me, then, perhaps for them.

152
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,367
What do I say?

153
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,745
Whatever you wish.

154
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,165
It's only for you and the gods to know.

155
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:49,245
I want him to see me as
more than his little girl.

156
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:55,209
Mine own father does not know
the language of girls either.

157
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,215
When I wish to talk with him,

158
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,385
I know that I must make the effort.

159
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,098
Thank you.

160
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,403
{n8}Your Grace.

161
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:24,780
{n8}I'm glad we could meet.

162
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:27,199
I know tempers ran hot today,

163
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:29,367
and I wanted to assure you
how much I value the bond

164
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,995
between our houses.

165
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,081
Rhaenys is my favorite cousin after all.

166
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:38,585
I wish to apologize for the tenor

167
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,962
at the Small Council today, Your Grace.

168
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,631
It was not my intent to make offense.

169
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:47,511
Your fleet is one of the realm's
most important assets, Lord Corlys.

170
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,721
But you must understand,

171
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,224
as King, it is my obligation to avoid war

172
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,518
until such time it is unavoidable.

173
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:56,729
None among us desire open war.

174
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,691
Might I speak plainly, Your Grace?

175
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:05,487
I always welcome the unfettered thoughts
of my council.

176
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:09,908
I fear that the eyes of our enemies
are presently fixed on the Red Keep.

177
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:12,285
The Queen has passed.

178
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,454
A girl has been named
heir to the Iron Throne,

179
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,414
the first in its history.

180
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,041
The King's brother, so disinherited,

181
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:20,252
has claimed the Targaryen seat
on Dragonstone

182
00:15:20,336 --> 00:15:21,879
without challenge.

183
00:15:22,921 --> 00:15:25,507
And now, a foreign power
has established a colony

184
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,718
in our most critical shipping lane.

185
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,556
You paint such an aspirant portrait
of my reign, Lord Corlys.

186
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,558
It is an honest one, cousin.

187
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,771
At the moment, The Crown is perceived
as being vulnerable.

188
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,648
And a blind incursion in the Stepstones

189
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,984
is the only way to demonstrate
that we are not?

190
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:47,612
To elude a storm,
you can either sail into it,

191
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,281
or around it.

192
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,825
But you must never await its coming.

193
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,037
Do you have a specific
course of action to propose,

194
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,748
my lord?

195
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:02,044
Join our families.

196
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:04,504
Wed our daughter, Laena.

197
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,799
Unite the two great surviving
Valyrian houses.

198
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,094
With the Targaryen dragons
and the Velaryon fleet bound in blood,

199
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,637
you can show the realm

200
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:15,473
that The Crown's strongest days are ahead,

201
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,642
not behind.

202
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,148
I must admit,

203
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,776
I haven't given marriage much thought.

204
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,862
It hasn't even been half a year
since Aemma passed.

205
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,490
The realm expects you to take a new wife
soon or late, Your Grace,

206
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,702
to strengthen your line
and produce more heirs.

207
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,914
You could not ask for
a stronger match than Laena.

208
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:09,111
We haven't spoken much

209
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,073
since.

210
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,203
A regret of mine.

211
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:23,500
We should be free to speak our minds
to one another.

212
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,126
You can say whatever you'd like.

213
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:26,920
You are the King.

214
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:39,141
I loved your mother very much.

215
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:43,771
As did I.

216
00:18:00,078 --> 00:18:03,248
Ser Harrold provided
a fine field of tourney knights.

217
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:04,458
Oh?

218
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:07,419
But in questioning them,

219
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:10,130
I discovered that Ser Criston
was the only man among them

220
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,341
with true battle experience.

221
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,719
He'll make a fine
knight of the Kingsguard.

222
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,811
- Today at Small Council--
- Pay it no mind.

223
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,689
- I thought I might have had some insight.
- You're young.

224
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:29,942
You will learn.

225
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:58,303
This is our best chance
to save the digit, Your Grace.

226
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,515
The maggots will remove the dead flesh

227
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,144
and hopefully stop the advance of the rot.

228
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,735
I held an audience earlier today

229
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,987
with Lord Corlys and Princess Rhaenys.

230
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:18,239
That was most charitable
of you, Your Grace.

231
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,201
I'm sure Lord Corlys
appreciated the spirit of it.

232
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,620
He proposed a marriage.

233
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,291
To whom, Your Grace?

234
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,585
The Lady Laena.

235
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,504
To combine the strength of our houses,

236
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,840
and demonstrate my reign's
strongest days are ahead,

237
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,008
not behind.

238
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,469
Lord Corlys has overreached, Your Grace.

239
00:19:40,304 --> 00:19:43,765
Such matters must be discussed
with the Small Council.

240
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,560
That is what I'm doing, presently.

241
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:51,648
So, what is your advice, dear Otto.

242
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:54,318
The Lady Laena

243
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:57,862
is young, Your Grace.

244
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:01,157
Indeed, but the wounds
made by the Great Council

245
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,159
still linger, my King.

246
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,496
A match with their daughter
would go a long way towards

247
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,581
sealing the breach

248
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,543
and uniting the two great Valyrian houses

249
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:15,088
would certainly signal unity
throughout the realm

250
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,673
and beyond.

251
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,801
The Grand Maester's reasoning is sound.

252
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,471
I do fear what Rhaenyra might think.

253
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,473
What does it matter, Your Grace?

254
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:27,892
Her mother has passed.

255
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:30,354
Her father must propagate the royal line.

256
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:41,365
I dearly loved my own lady wife.

257
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,410
The pain of her passing still haunts me.

258
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,122
And to be compelled to

259
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,918
replace her for duty's sake.

260
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,213
You are the King.

261
00:20:57,339 --> 00:20:59,257
But I do not envy you.

262
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,705
What was it like flying the Black Dread?

263
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:33,667
{n8}You were Balerion's last rider.

264
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:37,420
Only for a short time before he died.

265
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,546
With Balerion

266
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,216
died the last memory of Valyria of Old.

267
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,969
But Vhagar still lives

268
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:46,179
somewhere.

269
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,181
Bit too large for the Dragonpit.

270
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,351
Some would say too large for our world.

271
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:55,396
- Do you know where she nests?
- I'm sorry?

272
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:57,482
Do you know where Vhagar is now?

273
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,276
The Dragonkeepers believe she made home

274
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,779
somewhere on the coast of the Narrow Sea.

275
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:06,491
The workers at Spicetown report
hearing her song at times.

276
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,702
They say it is a sad thing.

277
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,456
I imagine even dragons get lonely.

278
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,420
Your Grace,

279
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,631
it would be a great honor

280
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:25,885
to join our houses
as they were in Old Valyria.

281
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,178
I would give you many children

282
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,180
of pure Valyrian blood

283
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,432
so that we might strengthen the royal line

284
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,017
and the realm.

285
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,270
Is that what your father told you to say?

286
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,818
What did your mother tell you?

287
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:46,907
That I wouldn't have to bed you
until I turned 14.

288
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,811
It bothers you, does it not?

289
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,276
My father is a king.

290
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:27,238
It is his duty to take a new wife
and strengthen his line.

291
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,531
I did not ask for a lesson in politics.

292
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:29,991
I asked whether this bothers you.

293
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,409
Laena is your daughter, Princess.

294
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,161
Does it bother you?

295
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,580
Of course, it does.

296
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,669
But I understand the order of things.

297
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:44,798
I'm not sure you do.

298
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:50,803
If you mean to elicit some anger from me,

299
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,640
you should know that
you're failing, Princess.

300
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,101
Quite the opposite.

301
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:01,189
Whether it's to my daughter
or to someone else's,

302
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,192
your father will remarry sooner than late.

303
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,612
His new wife will produce new heirs,

304
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,573
and chances are better than not
that one of those will be male.

305
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:13,242
And when that boy comes of age
and your father has passed,

306
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:16,204
the men of the realm
will expect him to be heir,

307
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,622
not you.

308
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,127
Because that is the order of things.

309
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:26,840
When I'm Queen, I will create a new order.

310
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,552
How I wish that could be, Rhaenyra.

311
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,805
But the men of the realm
already had their opportunity

312
00:24:33,889 --> 00:24:36,224
to appoint a ruling queen
at the Great Council

313
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,809
and they denied it.

314
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,770
They denied you, Princess Rhaenys.

315
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,732
"The Queen Who Never Was."

316
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:47,276
But they bent the knee to me
and called me heir to the throne.

317
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,322
Do you remind your father's men of that
as you carry their cups?

318
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,828
Here is the hard truth,

319
00:24:56,912 --> 00:25:00,081
which no one else has
the heart to tell you.

320
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:04,627
Men would sooner put
the realm to the torch

321
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,631
than see a woman ascend the Iron Throne.

322
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,096
And your father is no fool.

323
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,530
The Small Council is urging me to remarry.

324
00:25:34,366 --> 00:25:36,910
It seems the realm wants for a new queen.

325
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,627
A good and kind queen
will give comfort to your subjects.

326
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,261
Does the Small Council
have a particular lady in mind?

327
00:25:56,179 --> 00:26:00,850
Lord Corlys Velaryon has offered
the hand of his daughter,

328
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,477
the Lady Laena.

329
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,522
A very strong match, Your Grace.

330
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,735
I must admit,
I don't know Laena very well.

331
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,946
I'm sure that she is good and kind,

332
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:17,575
and that she will enjoy your company,
as I have, Your Grace.

333
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:34,676
I brought you something.

334
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:57,365
I asked the stonemasons to mend it.

335
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,329
This is

336
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,207
a very kind gesture, Alicent.

337
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,589
Very kind.

338
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:21,556
Come.

339
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,144
The Hand, Your Grace.

340
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,943
Your Grace, I've called the Small Council
to an emergency session.

341
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:34,944
Why?

342
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,698
I think it best you hear it directly.

343
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,242
Very well.

344
00:27:52,971 --> 00:27:57,859
_

345
00:27:58,567 --> 00:28:02,522
_

346
00:28:02,642 --> 00:28:07,215
_

347
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:12,153
_

348
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:15,109
- Daemon.
- The Prince left a missive,

349
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,195
which I believe might explain.

350
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:21,032
"It is the pleasure of Daemon Targaryen,

351
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:22,908
"the Prince of Dragonstone

352
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:26,912
"and rightful heir to the Iron Throne,

353
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,749
"to announce that he is
to take a second wife

354
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,752
"in the tradition of Old Valyria.

355
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:37,923
"She is to assume the title
Lady Mysaria of Dragonstone.

356
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:39,967
"Her Grace is with child

357
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:45,222
"and is to have a dragon's egg
placed in the babe's cradle

358
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,601
in the custom of House Targaryen."

359
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:52,313
The Prince has invited you
to his wedding, Your Grace.

360
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,525
- It is in two days' time.
- Gods be good.

361
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,611
Who is Lady Mysaria?

362
00:28:58,695 --> 00:29:00,405
- We believe--
- Daemon's whore.

363
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,118
- This is nothing less than sedition.
- I strongly agree, sire.

364
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,329
My brother wishes to provoke me.

365
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,082
To answer is to give him what he wants.

366
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:13,459
The realm is watching, Your Grace.

367
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,086
What would you have me do?

368
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,088
Send him to the Wall?

369
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:19,715
Perhaps I could put his head on a spike.

370
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,675
Daemon has seized Dragonstone,

371
00:29:21,676 --> 00:29:24,512
has surrounded himself
with an army of gold cloaks,

372
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,681
and has now stolen a dangerous weapon.

373
00:29:31,166 --> 00:29:34,221
_

374
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:45,082
_

375
00:29:46,489 --> 00:29:51,152
_

376
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:56,628
Assemble a detachment, Otto.

377
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,755
I will go to Dragonstone
and drag Daemon back

378
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:02,133
- to face justice myself.
- Your Grace.

379
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,678
My apologies, Your Grace,
but I cannot allow it.

380
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,346
It's too dangerous.

381
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,349
Daemon is without limit.

382
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,477
Let me go to Dragonstone.

383
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,798
You're the most comely girl at court.

384
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,884
Why do you destroy yourself?

385
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,434
Will you see the King tonight?

386
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:57,730
If you wish it.

387
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,069
- Good day, Ser Criston.
- My Lady.

388
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,156
I've assembled 20 of your best
household guards, my Lord Hand.

389
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,367
Sir Harrold will also join us.

390
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:16,583
Please look after the Hand, Ser Criston.

391
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,790
Welcome to Dragonstone, Otto.

392
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,253
Your occupation of this island
is at an end.

393
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,423
You're to relinquish the dragon's egg,

394
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:48,966
disband your army,

395
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,843
banish your whore,

396
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:54,680
and leave Dragonstone
by order of His Grace,

397
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,182
- King Viserys.
- Where is the King? I don't see him.

398
00:32:57,183 --> 00:33:01,062
His Grace would never lower himself
to entertain such a mummer's farce.

399
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,152
Ser Crispin, wasn't it?

400
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:09,778
Ser Criston Cole, my Prince.

401
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:11,948
Yes, apologies. I couldn't recall.

402
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,992
Perhaps my Prince recalls
when I knocked him off his horse.

403
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,204
Very good.

404
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:21,206
This is a truly pathetic show, Daemon.

405
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:23,125
Are you so desperate
for the King's attention

406
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,836
that you've resorted to skulking about
like a common cutpurse?

407
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,422
I'm simply keeping with
the traditions of my house,

408
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:30,341
the same as my brother did for his heir.

409
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,302
Those traditions are for the trueborn
children of royalty,

410
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,097
not for bastards fathered
on a common whore.

411
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,766
Lady Mysaria is to be my wife.

412
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,225
This is an abomination.

413
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:42,144
With every breath you soil your name,

414
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,021
your house, and your brother's reign.

415
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,233
Our love does not know
titles and traditions.

416
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,903
And what of you, men of the City Watch?

417
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,488
Aiding the Prince in his treason?

418
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,531
The King made me their commander.

419
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,950
They are loyal to me.

420
00:33:57,034 --> 00:33:58,953
You've come for the egg.

421
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:01,706
Here it is.

422
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,084
Are you mad?

423
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:07,920
- You'd never survive this.
- Well, happily, neither would you.

424
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:14,051
To chose violence, here,
is to declare war against your King.

425
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,261
Wonderful.

426
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,849
Even if it ends in the death
of your unborn child and its mother?

427
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:00,014
All of you,

428
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:02,600
sheathe the fucking steel.

429
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,961
- What are you doing here, Princess?
- Preventing bloodshed.

430
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:16,048
Ser Criston, please escort
the Princess to safety.

431
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,009
Take care not to startle Syrax, my lords.

432
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,469
She's rather protective of me.

433
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,982
_

434
00:36:27,102 --> 00:36:31,635
_

435
00:36:31,755 --> 00:36:34,095
_

436
00:36:34,215 --> 00:36:36,427
_

437
00:36:36,547 --> 00:36:38,099
_

438
00:36:38,737 --> 00:36:40,963
_

439
00:36:41,083 --> 00:36:42,517
_

440
00:36:42,637 --> 00:36:44,243
_

441
00:36:45,513 --> 00:36:50,361
_

442
00:36:50,481 --> 00:36:52,725
_

443
00:36:52,845 --> 00:36:55,491
_

444
00:36:56,594 --> 00:36:57,730
_

445
00:37:00,636 --> 00:37:01,995
_

446
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,939
I'm right here, Uncle,

447
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,026
the object of your ire,

448
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,654
the reason that you were disinherited.

449
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,031
If you wish to be restored as heir,

450
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:24,659
you'll need to kill me.

451
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,078
So, do it.

452
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,539
And be done with all this bother.

453
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:26,155
You announced that we were to be wed?

454
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,949
On the morrow.

455
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,578
And that I was with child.

456
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:35,038
Your child.

457
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,375
Well, perhaps when we are wed,
we can make that true.

458
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:42,421
I ensured long ago that I would never be
threatened by childbirth.

459
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,340
Good. Children can be such
irritating creatures.

460
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,010
You swore to protect me, Daemon.

461
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,348
Dragonstone is quite secure.

462
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:58,937
Until the King decides to reclaim
his ancestral seat.

463
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,773
His men might not put
the Prince's head on a spike,

464
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,109
but what would they do
with the common whore

465
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,862
he claims he's taken to wife
and made with child?

466
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,489
No one will harm you.

467
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:13,994
I have been sold as property
more times than I care to count,

468
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,498
beginning in a homeland
I can no longer recall.

469
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:22,128
Most of my years have been spent
living in terror.

470
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:25,005
You're safe with me, I swear it.

471
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,465
You are Targaryen.

472
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,718
You can afford to play
your stupid games with the King,

473
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,720
but I cannot.

474
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:37,517
I didn't come into your service
wanting gold or power

475
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:39,728
or station.

476
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:43,566
- I came to you to be liberated.
- Liberated.

477
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,862
From what?

478
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,322
Fear.

479
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,268
No, please, Lord Lyonel.

480
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:28,026
I have come looking for
an unencumbered opinion.

481
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:30,571
That's all I would ever give, Your Grace.

482
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:35,075
Ever since my name was read
by the archmaesters at the Great Council,

483
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,537
I have felt Corlys Velaryon's
envious gaze staring at me

484
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:40,164
from across the Blackwater.

485
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:44,543
You sit upon the highest seat
in the realm, Your Grace.

486
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:46,962
Proud men don't like having to look up.

487
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,927
Laena Velaryon.

488
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:57,722
Lord Corlys is your Master of Ships

489
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:01,601
and she is the eldest daughter
of the wealthiest house in the realm.

490
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:05,438
She comes from
unimpeachable Valyrian stock

491
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,150
and she has Targaryen blood.

492
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,111
- What's to mislike?
- She is 12.

493
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,738
She will mature.

494
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:16,867
I never asked to remarry.

495
00:42:17,576 --> 00:42:20,704
As King, you have a claim on all things.

496
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,123
Even those you don't want.

497
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,209
Marriage is not an obligation
you can put off for long.

498
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:28,920
What if I was to reject
Lord Corlys's proposal?

499
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:31,257
He would not be like to take it well.

500
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,636
I fear nothing short of a direct line
to the Iron Throne would satisfy him.

501
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:39,181
You should also consider
that we find ourselves

502
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,350
on the precipice of war in the Stepstones.

503
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,312
And the Sea Snake holds claim to nearly
half the realm's ships.

504
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,440
He would not dare withhold them
in the face of the realm's need.

505
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:53,195
- Who is he to hector me?
- No one, Your Grace.

506
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:58,784
But Driftmark makes for a better ally
than it does an enemy.

507
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,454
The Sea Snake has made a calculated reach,

508
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,665
a fair play for a man of his position.

509
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:09,502
If you truly want my unencumbered opinion.

510
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:10,587
I do.

511
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:14,133
You should wed Laena Velaryon, Your Grace.

512
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:18,720
Sate Lord Corlys and fix him at your side,

513
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:20,639
permanently, as an ally.

514
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,770
Your Grace,

515
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:29,856
the Princess has returned
from Dragonstone.

516
00:43:29,857 --> 00:43:31,608
Dragonstone?

517
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:52,713
Your Grace.

518
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,885
You disobeyed me.

519
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,973
You fled King's Landing without a word

520
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:06,602
and you acted without The Crown's leave.

521
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,940
You are my only heir.

522
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:15,110
You could've been killed.

523
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,115
May I sit?

524
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,878
You went to Dragonstone.

525
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:36,006
And retrieved the egg without bloodshed.

526
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,470
A feat I'm not sure Ser Otto
could've accomplished alone.

527
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,475
Yes, well,

528
00:44:51,313 --> 00:44:53,857
I sometimes forget
how alike you both were.

529
00:45:04,243 --> 00:45:08,414
Your mother's absence
is a wound that will never heal.

530
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,166
Without her,

531
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:16,421
the Red Keep has lost a warmth
that I dare say it will never recover.

532
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:19,633
It pleases me to hear you say this.

533
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:27,140
To know that I'm not alone in my grief.

534
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:29,642
I wish I had known better

535
00:45:29,643 --> 00:45:31,937
what to say to you in the aftermath.

536
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:38,318
I struggled to realize that my daughter
had so quickly become a woman grown.

537
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,949
But I know

538
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:48,286
she understands
what is now expected of me.

539
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,789
The King must take a new wife.

540
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,088
I could never replace your mother.

541
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:02,634
No more than I intend
to replace you as heir.

542
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,638
But you are my only heir

543
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,892
and our line is vulnerable,
too easily ended.

544
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:13,103
And by marrying again,
I may begin to ensure

545
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:14,729
that we are better defended.

546
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:15,897
Against whom?

547
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:18,108
Whomever may dare to challenge us.

548
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:27,367
I do not wish to make us estranged.

549
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,703
You are the King,

550
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:33,874
and so, your first duty is to the realm.

551
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,879
Mother would've understood this.

552
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,133
Just as I do.

553
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,015
Good morrow, my lords.

554
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:46,822
I have decided to take a new wife.

555
00:48:05,257 --> 00:48:06,925
I intend to marry

556
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,726
the Lady Alicent Hightower

557
00:48:17,686 --> 00:48:19,605
before spring's end.

558
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,988
This is an absurdity.

559
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,950
My house is Valyrian,

560
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:34,161
the greatest power in the realm.

561
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,456
And I am your King.

562
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,523
Rhaenyra.

563
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:29,466
House Velaryon's origins
reach back to Old Valyria.

564
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:34,096
More ancient even than House Targaryen

565
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,974
according to some texts.

566
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,061
But unlike the Targaryens,

567
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,064
we were no dragonlords.

568
00:49:45,691 --> 00:49:49,986
For centuries, my house had to scratch out
an existence from the sea

569
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:52,614
with grit and luck.

570
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:57,244
When I ascended the Driftwood Throne,

571
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,038
I knew what I wanted.

572
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,042
So I went out and seized it.

573
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:07,086
Unlike every other lord of the realm,

574
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:10,214
I can say that I built
my house's high seat

575
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,426
with the strength of mine own back.

576
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,726
I've always thought of
you and I as having been

577
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,562
made from the same cloth.

578
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,406
I wasn't aware you had
a king for a brother.

579
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:38,910
We're both men who have had to cut
our own way through the world.

580
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,789
We've been passed over too often.

581
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:46,876
Did you call me to Driftmark

582
00:50:46,877 --> 00:50:49,337
to remind me of my
low standing, Lord Corlys,

583
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:51,339
or was there some other reason?

584
00:50:55,177 --> 00:50:57,304
You've heard of the troubles
in the Stepstones?

585
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:04,560
<i>Some Myrish Prince
is feeding Westerosi sailors to the crabs.</i>

586
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:07,313
<i>I have been petitioning
the King to send my navy</i>

587
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,107
<i>into the territory,</i>

588
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,109
but he's denied me.

589
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,611
It was never my brother's strongest trait.

590
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:14,654
What?

591
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,616
Being King.

592
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,497
<i>The Crabfeeder is backed
by powerful entities</i>

593
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:28,126
<i>within the Free Cities who wish to see
Westeros weakened.</i>

594
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:33,882
<i>And the King's failures
have allowed him to accumulate strength.</i>

595
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,720
If those shipping lanes fall,

596
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,722
my house will be crippled.

597
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,933
And I will not have Driftmark
beggared while our King

598
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:47,520
idles himself with feasts,
and balls, and tourneys.

599
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:50,524
I will speak of my brother as I wish.

600
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:53,985
You will not.

601
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:59,198
Waiting in the Stepstones

602
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,409
is a chance for you to prove your worth

603
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,787
to any who might yet doubt it.

604
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,041
We are the realm's second sons, Daemon.

605
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,503
Our worth is not given.

606
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,048
It must be made.

607
00:52:32,399 --> 00:52:43,317
