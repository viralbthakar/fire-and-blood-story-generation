- What is it?
- Something very special.

188

You're the only one

Indeed.

190
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:37,415
And we felt badly about it,

191
00:14:37,499 --> 00:14:40,418
so we found one for you.

192
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:43,337

193
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,465

- They made me do it!
- As if you needed encouragement.

225
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:25,916
Your obsession with those beasts

226
00:17:25,917 --> 00:17:27,084
goes beyond understanding.

227
00:17:27,085 --> 00:17:28,336
They gave me a pig!

228
00:17:28,711 --> 00:17:30,129
A what?

229
00:17:30,213 --> 00:17:31,714
They said they found a dragon for me.

230
00:17:31,798 --> 00:17:34,133
The last ring has no legs at all.

231

But it was a pig.

it, apparently, and a tail.

King Viserys: The lad shouldn't
have been so credulous.

He's a child.

238

He thought they'd happened upon

239
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,490
some wild unnamed dragon

240
00:17:57,574 --> 00:17:59,074
and lured it to the Dragonpit?

241
00:17:59,075 --> 00:18:00,576
Your grandsons are a menace.

242
00:18:00,577 --> 00:18:02,578
They're more children than he is.

Th-They're savages.
And it's not surprising.

244
00:18:07,834 --> 00:18:09,836
Are you sure it wasn't our
Aegon who put them up to it?

245
00:18:14,716 --> 00:18:16,676
It's a wonder to me
their eggs ever hatched.

246
00:18:18,094 --> 00:18:20,137
- And why is that?
- You know why.

247
00:18:20,138 --> 00:18:23,182
- I'm afraid I don't.
- Don't! (inhales)

248
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:26,269
(exhales) Viserys.

249
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,689
We shall continue
this afternoon, Eddard.

250
00:18:38,114 --> 00:18:40,783
I have raised this matter before

251
00:18:40,867 --> 00:18:43,286
and you forbade me to speak of
it, so I held my tongue.

252
00:18:45,163 --> 00:18:47,706
To have one child
like that is a mistake,

253
00:18:47,707 --> 00:18:49,583
to have three is an insult,

254
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:52,336
to the throne, to you,

255
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:54,588
to House Velaryon and the match you
battled so hard to make for her.

256
00:18:54,589 --> 00:18:58,092
Not to mention decency itself.

257
00:18:59,427 --> 00:19:01,262
I had a black mare once.

258
00:19:02,221 --> 00:19:03,848
Black like a raven.

259
00:19:03,932 --> 00:19:05,849
One day, she escaped her pasture

260
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:09,354
and the neighboring stallion
sired a foal on her.

261
00:19:11,648 --> 00:19:15,734
The stallion was as silver as
the moon on a winter's night

262
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:18,529
and the foal, when it was born,

263
00:19:18,613 --> 00:19:21,323
chestnut.
(chuckles)

264
00:19:21,324 --> 00:19:25,662
Just the most unremarkable
brown horse you ever saw.

265
00:19:27,455 --> 00:19:29,916
Nature is a thing of mysterious works.

266
00:19:35,338 --> 00:19:37,590
How do you know?

267
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:41,552
The silver stallion.

268
00:19:41,636 --> 00:19:43,054
How do you know it was him?

269
00:19:45,181 --> 00:19:46,724
Did you witness the act itself?

270
00:19:46,808 --> 00:19:48,142
(bangs table)

271
00:19:51,104 --> 00:19:53,188
The consequences

272
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:56,442
of an allegation
like the one you toy at

273
00:19:56,526 --> 00:19:58,152
would be dire.

274
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:06,243
(Viserys sighs)

275
00:20:06,244 --> 00:20:08,496
Do not speak of this again.

276
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,342
Alicent: <i>Have I lost my
sanity, Ser Criston?</i>

277
00:20:21,426 --> 00:20:22,468
Do my senses lead me astray?

278
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:23,219
Or is everyone else asleep,

279
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,346
dreaming the same woolly dream?

280
00:20:25,430 --> 00:20:27,348
Sometimes seems so, Your Grace.

281
00:20:30,143 --> 00:20:32,144
She flaunts the privilege of
her inheritance without shame.

282
00:20:32,145 --> 00:20:34,271
She expects everyone in the
Red Keep to deny the truth

283
00:20:34,272 --> 00:20:35,773
our eyes can all plainly see.

284
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:37,066
- And the King, her father--
- He knows.

285
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:37,942
Of course, he knows.
Or did once,

286
00:20:37,943 --> 00:20:39,026
but has convinced himself otherwise.

287
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,738
He'll do naught
but make excuses for her.

288
00:20:42,739 --> 00:20:46,408
The Princess Rhaenyra
is brazen and relentless.

289
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:48,953
A spider who stings
and sucks her prey dry.

290
00:20:50,538 --> 00:20:52,582
A spoiled cunt.

291
00:20:57,044 --> 00:21:00,339
That was beneath me,
Your Grace. I apologize.

292
00:21:03,718 --> 00:21:05,552
I have to believe,

293
00:21:05,553 --> 00:21:09,140
that in the end,
honor and decency will prevail.

294
00:21:10,308 --> 00:21:13,478
We need to hew to that
and to each other.

295
00:21:14,353 --> 00:21:16,147
(bell tolling)

296
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:20,359
(grunting)

297
00:21:27,784 --> 00:21:29,368
(grunting)

298
00:21:32,455 --> 00:21:34,791
- Alicent: Whose idea was it?
- Oh!

299
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,002
(Aegon grunts)

300
00:21:39,212 --> 00:21:39,837
The pig.

301
00:21:39,921 --> 00:21:43,299
- Was it your plot?
- No...

302
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,843
it was Jace

303
00:21:45,927 --> 00:21:48,262
and... uh...

304
00:21:48,346 --> 00:21:50,180
it-it was the two of them.

305
00:21:50,181 --> 00:21:51,849
I couldn't be sure.

306
00:21:51,933 --> 00:21:53,392
Aemond is your brother.

307
00:21:53,476 --> 00:21:55,644
- Well, he's a twat.
- We are family.

308
00:21:55,645 --> 00:21:57,146
You may cuff him about
as you wish at home,

309
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,316
but in the world...
we must defend our own.

310
00:22:01,317 --> 00:22:02,443
It was funny.

311
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:03,694
Do you think Rhaenyra's sons

312
00:22:03,778 --> 00:22:05,196
will be your playthings forever?

313
00:22:07,031 --> 00:22:08,866
As things stand...

314
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,117
Rhaenyra will ascend the throne

315
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:13,203
and Jacaerys Targaryen
will be her heir.

316
00:22:13,204 --> 00:22:15,038
- So?
- Ugh! You are nearly a man-grown.

317
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,250
How is it that you can be
so shortsighted?

318
00:22:19,961 --> 00:22:23,464
If Rhaenyra comes into power...

319
00:22:23,548 --> 00:22:25,174
your very life could be forfeit.

320
00:22:27,218 --> 00:22:29,428
Aemond's as well.

321
00:22:29,512 --> 00:22:32,264
She could move to cut off any
challenge to her succession.

322
00:22:32,265 --> 00:22:34,975
- Then I won't challenge--
- (yells) You are the challenge!

323
00:22:34,976 --> 00:22:35,726
You are the challenge, Aegon!

324
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:39,230
Simply by living and breathing!

325
00:22:43,818 --> 00:22:46,737
You are the King's firstborn son...

326
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:49,698
and what they know,
what everyone in the realm knows

327
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:51,659
in their blood and in their bones...

328
00:22:52,577 --> 00:22:55,872
is that one day, you will be our King.

329
00:23:04,755 --> 00:23:05,798
Get dressed.

330
00:23:08,009 --> 00:23:09,135

Harwin: So that's what
this is about then?

499

Shame on the whole of House Strong.

501

Harwin: Because I laid my hands
on that insufferable Cole,

502
00:33:39,223 --> 00:33:42,475
- the son of a steward?
- He is a Knight of the Kingsguard now,

503
00:33:42,476 --> 00:33:44,477
- a defender of the crown.
- Harwin: He assailed Prince Jacaerys,

- the future heir to the throne.

us open to accusations

507
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:56,657
And what treachery is that?

Don't play the fool with me, boy.

Your intimacy with
the Princess Rhaenyra

father towards his child.

657
00:43:26,101 --> 00:43:28,144
Jasper Wylde: I've heard
tale that Lord Grover's son

658
00:43:28,228 --> 00:43:30,479
now rules Riverrun in all but name.

659
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,523
Well, he is also a Tully

660
00:43:32,524 --> 00:43:34,775
and this remains a Tully problem.

661
00:43:34,776 --> 00:43:37,111
I would agree.

662
00:43:37,112 --> 00:43:39,530
- If we may move on, my lords--
- Rhaenyra: And yet,

663
00:43:39,531 --> 00:43:41,157
the Brackens and the Blackwoods

664
00:43:41,241 --> 00:43:42,325
will use any excuse
to spill each other's blood.

665
00:43:46,412 --> 00:43:49,832
So... this dispute
bears looking into.

666
00:43:49,833 --> 00:43:52,835
There will be countryfolk who know where
the lines have been drawn for generations.

667
00:43:52,836 --> 00:43:55,171
That is easy enough.

668
00:43:56,256 --> 00:43:57,715
(softly) Of course.

669
00:43:59,926 --> 00:44:02,094
Ser Tyland.

670
00:44:02,095 --> 00:44:04,513
Tyland Lannister: (clears throat)
Uh, we should address

671
00:44:04,514 --> 00:44:06,599
the latest developments
in the Stepstones, my lords.

672
00:44:06,683 --> 00:44:09,393
(sighs) Will we ever be
shut of that blasted place?

673
00:44:09,394 --> 00:44:12,063
If you ask me, I think
the Blackwoods have

674
00:44:12,147 --> 00:44:13,689
- the upper hand.
- Alicent: No.

675
00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:16,317
We've moved on to the
Stepstones, Lord Beesbury.

676
00:44:16,401 --> 00:44:19,862
(louder) And the Triarchy's
new alliance with Dorne.

677
00:44:19,863 --> 00:44:24,366
I was hoping our negotiations with
Sunspear might persuade them to see reason.

678
00:44:24,367 --> 00:44:27,703
(coughs) To trust a Martell
is to be disappointed.

679
00:44:27,704 --> 00:44:31,165
Jasper: And where, I wonder,
is our Prince Daemon?

680
00:44:31,166 --> 00:44:33,709
Or I suppose I should call him
King, as he styled himself

681
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:34,669
when he won a battle there...

682
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:37,213
- once.
- Alicent: That was a decade ago

683
00:44:37,297 --> 00:44:38,380
and he has since left
the region undefended.

684
00:44:38,381 --> 00:44:41,050
Rhaenyra: We have left it undefended.

685
00:44:41,134 --> 00:44:43,219
There should've been
fortifications built,

686
00:44:43,303 --> 00:44:46,055
watchtowers, a fleet of ships,

687
00:44:46,139 --> 00:44:47,890
a garrison of soldiers
sent to hold our ground.

688
00:44:47,891 --> 00:44:50,059
We cannot afford it.

689
00:44:51,477 --> 00:44:55,397
Our coffers are great,
but not infinite.

690
00:44:55,398 --> 00:44:57,399
We must consider
the cost to our subjects.

691
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,445
- I must agree.
- The cost of war is greater.

692
00:45:02,906 --> 00:45:07,994
But we have been lax and the
old monster now lifts its head.

693
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:14,500
Let us be finished.

694
00:45:14,584 --> 00:45:17,128
(sighs) Yes.

695
00:45:21,674 --> 00:45:23,467
Wait.

696
00:45:23,468 --> 00:45:25,136
I wish to speak.

697
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:27,472
Be seated.

698
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,734
I have felt the...

699
00:45:40,902 --> 00:45:43,279
strife...

700
00:45:43,363 --> 00:45:45,531
between our families of late, my Queen.

701
00:45:48,368 --> 00:45:52,121
And for any offense given
by mine, I apologize.

702
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:55,500
But we are one house.

703
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:59,920
And long before that,

704
00:45:59,921 --> 00:46:03,049
we were friends.

705
00:46:06,803 --> 00:46:10,473
My son Jacaerys will inherit
the Iron Throne after me.

706
00:46:10,557 --> 00:46:12,517
I propose we betroth him
to your daughter, Helaena.

707
00:46:14,102 --> 00:46:17,563
Ally ourselves...

708
00:46:17,647 --> 00:46:19,274
once and for all.

709
00:46:19,899 --> 00:46:21,817
Let them rule together.

710
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:23,569
A most judicious proposition.

711
00:46:28,866 --> 00:46:32,536
Additionally, if Syrax brings
forth another clutch of eggs,

712
00:46:32,537 --> 00:46:34,998
your son Aemond will have
his choice of them, uh...

713
00:46:36,207 --> 00:46:38,793
a symbol of our goodwill.

714
00:46:41,004 --> 00:46:43,298
Rhaenyra.

715
00:46:51,222 --> 00:46:53,683
Rhaenyra:
Oh, Seven Hells, um.

716
00:46:55,143 --> 00:46:57,561
My dear...

717
00:46:57,562 --> 00:47:00,148
a dragon's egg is a handsome gift.

718
00:47:01,691 --> 00:47:03,317
The King and I thank you for your offer

719
00:47:03,318 --> 00:47:05,236
and we will consider it duly.

720
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,447
You must rest now, husband.

721
00:47:10,742 --> 00:47:11,993
Yes.

722
00:47:17,457 --> 00:47:20,334
Alicent:
<i>How sweetly the fox speaks</i>

723
00:47:20,335 --> 00:47:22,211
<i>when it's been cornered by the hounds.</i>

724
00:47:22,295 --> 00:47:25,339
- She is sincere.
- She is desperate.

725
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,715
She feels the earth
washing away beneath her feet

726
00:47:26,716 --> 00:47:30,010
and now she expects us
to ignore her transgressions

727
00:47:30,011 --> 00:47:31,887
and for me to marry my only daughter

728
00:47:31,888 --> 00:47:33,264
to one of her...

729
00:47:33,348 --> 00:47:35,224
plain-featured sons.

730
00:47:35,308 --> 00:47:37,769
The proposal is a good one, my Queen.

731
00:47:38,978 --> 00:47:40,396
We're a family.

732
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,982
Let us put aside
these childish quarrels.

733
00:47:43,066 --> 00:47:45,443
Join hands and be stronger for it.

734
00:47:46,486 --> 00:47:47,612
You may do as you wish, husband...

735
00:47:49,489 --> 00:47:51,866
when I am cold in my grave.

736
00:47:52,825 --> 00:47:55,744
Alicent.

737
00:47:55,745 --> 00:47:58,873
Alicent!

738
00:48:07,673 --> 00:48:09,217
(coughs)

739
00:48:10,635 --> 00:48:12,220
(exhales)

740
00:48:15,765 --> 00:48:18,810
(groans)

741
00:48:20,353 --> 00:48:22,480
I do not need the blanket--

742
00:48:25,983 --> 00:48:28,193
Criston:
The Hand, Your Grace.

743
00:48:28,194 --> 00:48:31,197
- The King is resting.
- I will see him.

744
00:48:32,365 --> 00:48:34,867
Lean forward.

745
00:48:34,951 --> 00:48:36,786
(fluffing pillow)

746
00:48:39,497 --> 00:48:40,914
(exhales)

747
00:48:40,915 --> 00:48:43,625
I'm being endlessly
fussed over, Lyonel.

748
00:48:43,626 --> 00:48:47,130
It's a wonder I can
visit the privy alone.

749
00:48:47,588 --> 00:48:48,840
Your Grace.

750
00:48:50,091 --> 00:48:52,135
What might this errand
be about, Lord Lyonel?

751
00:48:55,179 --> 00:48:56,431
Your Grace, I feel...

752
00:48:58,141 --> 00:49:00,685
I have come to resign my
position as Hand of the King.

753
00:49:03,229 --> 00:49:04,855
The episode in the yard this morning.

754
00:49:04,856 --> 00:49:07,149
My son Harwin has disgraced himself

755
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:11,070
and every fishwife in King's Landing
will soon be telling the tale.

756
00:49:11,154 --> 00:49:13,739
Young Harwin's outburst
was unfortunate,

757
00:49:13,823 --> 00:49:15,407
it's true.

758
00:49:15,408 --> 00:49:17,159
But he's been expelled
from the City Watch.

759
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:18,494
That seems punishment enough.

760
00:49:18,578 --> 00:49:20,955
Forgive me, Your Grace, it is not.

761
00:49:28,129 --> 00:49:32,257
You have served me
faithfully for many years,

762
00:49:32,258 --> 00:49:35,219
10 as Hand.

763
00:49:35,303 --> 00:49:36,428
Your advice has been sage,

764
00:49:36,429 --> 00:49:40,057
unmarked by self-interest...

765
00:49:40,141 --> 00:49:42,768
which stands in contrast to all others.

766
00:49:44,228 --> 00:49:46,980
Lyonel:
You speak kind words...

767
00:49:46,981 --> 00:49:49,108
but there is a shadow over my house

768
00:49:49,192 --> 00:49:51,360
and it grows... ever darker.

769
00:49:51,444 --> 00:49:53,946
I can no longer serve you
with integrity.

770
00:49:55,406 --> 00:49:56,991
What is this shadow?

771
00:49:58,493 --> 00:49:59,910
Name it, if it casts such a gloom.

772
00:49:59,911 --> 00:50:05,541
Yes... we must have your
reasoning in plain language.

773
00:50:13,591 --> 00:50:16,552
I cannot.

774
00:50:16,636 --> 00:50:18,303
Then I cannot accept this.

775
00:50:18,304 --> 00:50:20,348
- My dear husband--
- Viserys: I said no!

776
00:50:21,599 --> 00:50:25,060
- If you insist, my King.
- I do.

777
00:50:25,061 --> 00:50:27,187
You will continue in your
service to the crown.

778
00:50:27,188 --> 00:50:28,981
(deep breath)

779
00:50:29,065 --> 00:50:32,067
I would then ask leave
to take my son from court

780
00:50:32,068 --> 00:50:34,236
and escort him back to the
family seat at Harrenhal.

781
00:50:34,237 --> 00:50:37,197
He is my heir

782
00:50:37,198 --> 00:50:39,074
and will be lord of
Harren's castle one day.

783
00:50:39,075 --> 00:50:40,868
It is time he assumed his duties there.

784
00:50:44,997 --> 00:50:48,042
Do it.

785
00:51:06,727 --> 00:51:07,895
Aren't you gonna help me?

786
00:51:19,532 --> 00:51:22,368
(distant chatter)

787
00:51:30,251 --> 00:51:33,087
(deep breath)

788
00:51:34,755 --> 00:51:37,842
(door opens, closes)

789
00:51:48,227 --> 00:51:49,811
Larys Strong:
I took the liberty of beginning

790
00:51:49,812 --> 00:51:51,021
without you, Your Grace.

791
00:51:51,022 --> 00:51:53,899
It seemed a sin to let
such a pie grow cold.

792
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,984
You did wisely, Lord Larys.

793
00:51:55,985 --> 00:51:59,655
Though you had no such worry
about the wine, surely.

794
00:51:59,739 --> 00:52:02,950
- Meat without wine is also a sin.
- Mm.

795
00:52:07,246 --> 00:52:10,666
It's been my duty to tell you
of happenings about the castle,

796
00:52:10,750 --> 00:52:13,752
but tonight you know, and I do not.

797
00:52:13,753 --> 00:52:16,588
The King had an audience
with my father.

798
00:52:16,589 --> 00:52:19,050
He attempted to resign his post.

799
00:52:20,259 --> 00:52:21,636
I thought as much.

800
00:52:22,553 --> 00:52:23,512
His honor's always been a millstone

801
00:52:23,596 --> 00:52:26,432
about his esteemed neck.

802
00:52:28,643 --> 00:52:29,643
Interesting you said "attempted"?

803
00:52:29,644 --> 00:52:33,855
My lord husband refused to accept.

804
00:52:33,856 --> 00:52:36,984
Then he fell short of confessing
my brother's... transgressions.

805
00:52:37,068 --> 00:52:40,112
With his eruption in the yard,
your brother

806
00:52:40,196 --> 00:52:42,364
all but confessed the truth himself.

807
00:52:42,365 --> 00:52:45,659
Truth has many flavors, Your Grace.

808
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:47,494
Do you expect the King to doom
his dear daughter to exile,

809
00:52:47,495 --> 00:52:50,748
- or even--
- (door opens)

810
00:52:51,916 --> 00:52:52,958
Talya, not now.

811
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:00,340
(door closes)

812
00:53:00,341 --> 00:53:03,135
It's a willful blindness, the King.

813
00:53:03,219 --> 00:53:04,761
I mean, you'd surely
suffer the same affliction,

814
00:53:04,762 --> 00:53:07,765
- if it came to it.
- I would not.

815
00:53:09,558 --> 00:53:12,394
Lord Lyonel is to escort
Ser Harwin back to Harrenhal

816
00:53:12,395 --> 00:53:16,440
to watch over his seat whilst
