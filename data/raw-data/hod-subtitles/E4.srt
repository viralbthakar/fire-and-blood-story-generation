More mature, perhaps.

168

You've matured yourself these
last four years, Princess.

You'll get used to the attention.

It's the rest I could do without.

172

My father seems content to sell me off

173

to whichever lord
has the biggest castle.

174

Tyland Lannister: The Stepstones
were meant to be won for the realm,

181
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:27,523
but over the past few days,
it seems we have traded

182
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,900
a crabfeeder for a seasnake.

183
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:34,571
This is clearly a rebuke for passing
over Lady Laena for Queen Alicent.

184
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:37,616
Years have passed since the
business with his daughter.

185
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,702
Certainly, he cannot still be wroth?

186
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:43,706
The Sea Snake is an over-proud
man, to be sure, Your Grace.

187
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,833
That pride has been injured.

188
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,836
Perhaps we can salve the wound?

189
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:52,071
I fear Lord Corlys's pride
is the least of our worries.

I don't wish to cause
you further distress,

191
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:58,178
Your Grace, but my brother has sent
disturbing word from Oldtown.

192
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,557
Lord Corlys is said to have
engaged in negotiations

193
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,250
with the Sealord of Braavos.

194
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:07,384
He plans to wed his daughter
Laena to the Sealord's son.

When we were Rhaenyra's age,

505
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,428
we fucked our way through
most of the brothels

506
00:49:14,433 --> 00:49:15,989
on the Street of Silk.

507

We were young men.

00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,951
She is just a girl.

509
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,245
- Your niece!
- Rhaenyra's a woman-grown.

Better her first experience
be with me than some whore.

You have ruined her!

00:49:28,965 --> 00:49:32,047
What lord will wed her now?
In this condition?

Who gives a fuck what some lord thinks?

You are the dragon.
Your word is truth and law.

I have spent a lifetime defending you.

517
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,242
But your heart is even
blacker than I thought.

518
00:49:44,247 --> 00:49:46,520
I should disinherit her

you said I could have anything.

522
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,789
I want Rhaenyra.
I'll take her as she is,

523
00:49:58,794 --> 00:50:00,826
and wed her in the tradition
of our house.

(chuckles) You are already wed.

She was a calculated distraction.

Your judgment has been compromised.

662
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,548
A loyal Hand must tell his king

663
00:59:17,553 --> 00:59:20,718
a discomforting truth
from time to time, Your Grace.

664
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:22,350
If he doesn't...

665
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,745
he's failed as a servant.

666
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:28,948
You were a faithful servant, Otto.

667
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:40,613
The crown and the realm

668
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:43,579
both owe you a debt
that can never be repaid.

669
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,495
But I can no longer trust your judgment.

Come.

673
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,742
I hope you can forgive
the late hour, Princess.

674
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:28,583
I took great care in its preparation.

675
01:00:31,361 --> 01:00:34,434
If not brewed properly,
it can either prove ineffective

676
01:00:34,439 --> 01:00:36,094
or else bear

677
01:00:36,099 --> 01:00:38,268
- unpleasant...
- Brewed properly?

678
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,804
I'm sorry, what is that?

679
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:44,281
A tea, Princess.

680
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,930
From the King.

681
01:00:47,935 --> 01:00:53,186
It will rid you of any
unwanted consequences.
