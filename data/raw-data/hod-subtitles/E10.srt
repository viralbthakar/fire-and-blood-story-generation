1
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:24,403
Here you are.
WWW.MY-SUBS.CO

2
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,944
The sea snake is going
to die, isn't he?

3
00:02:38,654 --> 00:02:39,693
Luke.

4
00:02:39,718 --> 00:02:41,272
It can't be Lord of the Tides.

5
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,608
Grandsire was the greatest
sailor who ever lived.

6
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,530
I get green sick before the
ship even leaves the harbour.

7
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,240
I'll just ruin everything.

8
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:52,969
I don't want Driftmark.

9
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,119
It should have passed
on to surveyman.

10
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,747
We don't choose our destiny,
Luke. It chooses us.

11
00:02:57,772 --> 00:03:01,519
Grandsire, let you choose
whether you be as a...

12
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,520
You told us so.

13
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,520
And do you want to
know the truth of it?

14
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,520
I was frightened.

15
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:18,767
I was four and ten.

16
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:20,983
Same as you are now.

17
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:25,094
I wasn't ready to be queen
of the Seven Kingdoms.

18
00:03:25,375 --> 00:03:32,520
But it was my duty, and in time I came to
understand I had to earn my inheritance.

19
00:03:34,477 --> 00:03:36,519
I'm not like you.

20
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,519
In what way, sweet boy?

21
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,864
Not so...

22
00:03:41,227 --> 00:03:42,519
perfect.

23
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,219
I am anything but.

24
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:59,502
My father looked after me and
helped prepare me for my duties.

25
00:03:59,527 --> 00:04:02,047
Your mother will do
the same for you.

26
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:04,496
Good morrow, Princess.

27
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:06,289
Good morrow, Sir Laurent.

28
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:09,769
Princess Renise has just
arrived on Dragonback.

29
00:04:09,887 --> 00:04:12,887
We urgently request an audience
with you and Prince Daemon.

30
00:04:30,137 --> 00:04:32,136
The Princess Rhaenys Targaryen.

31
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:33,969
Thank you, Sir Laurence.

32
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:41,945
Princess Rhaenys, might we hope
for news of Lord Corlys's recovery?

33
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,515
Viserys is dead.

34
00:04:48,991 --> 00:04:51,862
I grieve this loss
with you, Rhaenyra.

35
00:04:51,957 --> 00:04:55,132
My cousin. Your father.

36
00:04:56,484 --> 00:04:58,484
Possessed a kind heart.

37
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,040
There is more.

38
00:05:11,648 --> 00:05:13,865
Aegon has been crowned
as his successor.

39
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:22,452
They crowned him.

40
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,040
How did Viserys die?

41
00:05:26,523 --> 00:05:28,040
I could not say.

42
00:05:28,585 --> 00:05:29,836
How long ago?

43
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,040
A day past, perhaps two.

44
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:33,604
I was made a prisoner in my quarters
while the Queen made her preparations.

45
00:05:33,628 --> 00:05:35,017
Viserys has been slain.

46
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,791
Alicent demanded you
declare for Aegon.

47
00:05:42,103 --> 00:05:43,320
She did.

48
00:05:45,697 --> 00:05:47,000
I refused her.

49
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:48,306
And yet you are alive.

50
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:55,000
The High Septon crowned
Aegon in the Dragonpit.

51
00:05:55,025 --> 00:05:58,025
I witnessed it myself just
before I fled on Maelys.

52
00:05:58,050 --> 00:06:01,295
They crowned him
before the masses.

53
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,599
So that the masses would see
him as their rightful king.

54
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,417
That whore of a queen murdered my brother and stole
his throne, and you could have burned more for it.

55
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:12,600
A war is like to be fought over
this treachery, to be sure.

56
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,831
But that war is
not mine to begin.

57
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,600
I only rushed this warning to you out of
loyalty to my husband and to my house.

58
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:27,522
The greens are coming
for you, Rhaenyra.

59
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,599
And for your children.

60
00:06:31,412 --> 00:06:33,792
You should leave
Dragonstone at once.

61
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:54,400
Baby's coming.

62
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,480
Her term is far from complete.
This should not be happening.

63
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,198
It is fucking happening!

64
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,160
Keep your head
about you, Princess.

65
00:07:11,185 --> 00:07:12,518
Come.

66
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,080
You've done this
five times before.

67
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,760
Keep your spirit in the
sixth volume, different.

68
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,068
Get off! Get off! Get off!

69
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,578
I want patrols along the island's perimeter,
looking for any small ships that might set

70
00:07:29,603 --> 00:07:30,603
ashore.

71
00:07:31,193 --> 00:07:35,081
If the Greens attack now, it
will be by stealth, not directly.

72
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,996
We don't have enough men to surround the island,
but we can make ourselves appear stronger

73
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:40,083
than they are.

74
00:07:43,309 --> 00:07:46,668
Conscript the Dragon Keepers, they're
capable fighters, waste no time.

75
00:07:46,693 --> 00:07:48,154
It will be done, my prince.

76
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,719
What was that?

77
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:02,927
I'm sorry.

78
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,189
You might go easier
on him, my prince...

79
00:08:07,213 --> 00:08:09,609
so he can learn what
you're trying to teach.

80
00:08:09,634 --> 00:08:11,634
Your lady mother
needs to see you.

81
00:08:13,396 --> 00:08:14,720
Both of you.

82
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,720
Mother?

83
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:21,720
Oh, fuck.

84
00:08:24,571 --> 00:08:25,997
Princess.

85
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,719
Your grandson, King
Viserys, has passed.

86
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,720
Viserys?

87
00:08:40,158 --> 00:08:44,873
The Greens have repudiated the
succession and claimed the Iron Throne.

88
00:08:48,423 --> 00:08:50,802
Aegon has been crowned king.

89
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,023
What is to be done about it?

90
00:08:53,048 --> 00:08:54,498
Nothing yet.

91
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,008
And where is Daemon?

92
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,787
I don't know. Gone to madness.

93
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,193
Gone to plot his war.

94
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,364
Leave Daemon with me.

95
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,763
Jace.

96
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:07,997
Jace.

97
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:16,832
Whatever claim remains to
me, you are now its heir.

98
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:19,934
Nought is to be done
but by my command.

99
00:09:34,229 --> 00:09:38,455
The raven flew in this morning, the sea snake's
fever is broken and he has left Edenfall.

100
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,753
Where is he sailing?

101
00:09:39,778 --> 00:09:41,762
That much is unclear, my prince.

102
00:09:41,787 --> 00:09:44,002
We'll send ravens to
our nearest allies.

103
00:09:44,027 --> 00:09:46,180
Lords Darkling, Massey...

104
00:09:46,671 --> 00:09:48,524
and Bar-Emon.

105
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:52,478
Do you want to speak to
the maester, my prince?

106
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,479
I'll fly to the riverlands myself
and affirm Lord Tully's support.

107
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,212
You will do no such thing.

108
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,480
My mother has decreed no action
be taken while she's a bed.

109
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,479
It's good you're
here, young prince.

110
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,017
You're needed to patrol
the skies on Vyrmax.

111
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,042
Did you hear what I said?

112
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,783
The ravens, Lord Bartimus.

113
00:10:30,307 --> 00:10:32,306
I shall see it done.

114
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:35,731
Summon to Stefan. Our King's Guard
are needed on the Dragonland.

115
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:39,809
Come with me. I'll show you
the true meaning of loyalty.

116
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,679
You swore an oath as
Knights of the King's Guard.

117
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,280
As do all who wear the
White Cloak, my Prince.

118
00:10:53,464 --> 00:10:54,664
To whom?

119
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,499
I swore first to King
Jehaerys, my Prince.

120
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:03,079
And then, to his grace, King
Viserys, when he succeeded him.

121
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:05,158
Do you acknowledge the
true line of succession?

122
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,620
Yes. Yes, my prince.

123
00:11:13,908 --> 00:11:15,588
Do you recall

124
00:11:15,777 --> 00:11:18,603
how King Viserys named his
his heir before his death?

125
00:11:21,771 --> 00:11:23,371
Princess Rhaenyra.

126
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,939
I'm grateful for your
long service to the Crown.

127
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
So I'm presenting
you with a choice.

128
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,720
I swear anew your oath to
Rhaenyra as your queen,

129
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:03,204
to Prince De Ceres as the
heir to the Iron Throne.

130
00:12:07,787 --> 00:12:11,787
Or if you support the
usurper speaker now,

131
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,220
then you will have a clean
and honourable death.

132
00:12:16,162 --> 00:12:18,161
But if you choose treachery,

133
00:12:18,491 --> 00:12:22,491
if you swear fealty now only
to later turn your cloaks,

134
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,599
know that you will die

135
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Screaming.

136
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:36,467
Princess, let us help you.

137
00:12:43,498 --> 00:12:45,497
Princess, please.

138
00:12:45,522 --> 00:12:47,521
You shouldn't do
this alone, Princess.

139
00:12:47,546 --> 00:12:48,600
Let us help you.

140
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,775
I mean no harm of us.

141
00:16:29,095 --> 00:16:30,959
I swear toward the Queen,

142
00:16:33,155 --> 00:16:35,133
With all my strength...

143
00:16:36,907 --> 00:16:38,934
and give my blood for hers,

144
00:16:43,896 --> 00:16:46,235
I shall take no wife...

145
00:16:47,098 --> 00:16:49,606
hold no lands,

146
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,961
father no children.

147
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,836
I shall guard her secrets,

148
00:16:54,942 --> 00:16:57,184
obey her commands,

149
00:16:57,583 --> 00:17:00,582
ride at her side, and
defend her name and

150
00:17:00,607 --> 00:17:01,903
and honor.

151
00:17:26,828 --> 00:17:28,266
My Queen.

152
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:09,070
Queen Rhaenyra Targaryen,
first of her name.

153
00:19:09,847 --> 00:19:12,847
Queen of the Andals and the
Rhoynar and the First Men.

154
00:19:13,816 --> 00:19:17,031
Lady of the Seven Kingdoms
and protector of the realm.

155
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:21,980
Your Grace.

156
00:19:30,389 --> 00:19:32,077
Wine, my queen.

157
00:19:34,734 --> 00:19:36,180
Thank you, Reyna.

158
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:38,020
Come.

159
00:20:01,726 --> 00:20:03,020
What is our standing?

160
00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:06,379
We have 30 knights, 100
crossbowmen, and 300 men-at-arms.

161
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,219
Dragonstone is relatively
easy to defend,

162
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:09,699
but as an instrument
of conquest,

163
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,939
our army leaves a
lot to be desired.

164
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,019
I've sent word to my loyal
men in the City Watch.

165
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,020
I'll have some support there,

166
00:20:15,021 --> 00:20:16,499
but I cannot speak
to the numbers.

167
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,979
We already have declarations
from Kelty, Gale, and Staunton,

168
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,429
Massey, Darkland, and Barremont.

169
00:20:24,788 --> 00:20:26,887
My lady mother was in Arran.

170
00:20:26,912 --> 00:20:29,191
The Vale will not turn
cloak against their own kin.

171
00:20:29,216 --> 00:20:30,875
River Run was always
a close friend

172
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,719
to your father, Your Grace.

173
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,199
With Prince Daemon's
acquiescence...

174
00:20:34,223 --> 00:20:37,007
I've already sent
ravens to Lord Grover.

175
00:20:40,235 --> 00:20:42,655
Lord Grover is fickle
and easily swayed.

176
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,936
He will need to be convinced
of the strength of our position

177
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,640
and that we will support
him should it come to war.

178
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,800
I'm going to treat
with him myself.

179
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,360
What of Storm's
End and Winterfell?

180
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:54,015
There has never lived a
Stark who forgot an oath,

181
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,679
and with how Stark
the North will follow.

182
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,242
Lord Boros Baratheon will need to be
reminded of his father's promises.

183
00:21:12,555 --> 00:21:14,555
What news from Driftmark?

184
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:19,148
Lord Caller sails
for Dragonstone.

185
00:21:19,336 --> 00:21:21,336
To declare for his Queen?

186
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:24,914
The Valarion fleet is
in my husband's yoke.

187
00:21:25,147 --> 00:21:26,670
He decides where they sail.

188
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,297
We shall pray for both you
and your husband's support.

189
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:33,679
Just as we prayed nightly for the
Sea Snakes' return to good health.

190
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:38,888
There's no port on the narrow sea we dare
to make an enemy of the Velaryon fleet.

191
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:41,680
And our enemies?

192
00:21:41,681 --> 00:21:43,679
We have no friends
among the Lannisters.

193
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,679
Tylander served the Hand too
long to turn against him.

194
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,019
An Otto Hightower needs
the Lannister fleet.

195
00:21:49,044 --> 00:21:52,880
Without the Lannisters, we're not like to
find any allies west of the Golden Tooth. no

196
00:21:55,598 --> 00:21:58,442
The Riverlands are
essential, Your Grace.

197
00:21:59,477 --> 00:22:02,802
Pray forgive my bluntness, Your
Grace, but talk of men is moot.

198
00:22:03,067 --> 00:22:05,129
Your cause owns a power...

199
00:22:05,153 --> 00:22:08,872
that has not been seen in this
world since the days of old Valyria.

200
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,997
Dragons!

201
00:22:13,379 --> 00:22:15,088
The Greens have dragons.

202
00:22:15,113 --> 00:22:17,036
They have three
adults, by my count.

203
00:22:17,061 --> 00:22:19,860
We have Cyrax,
Caraxes, and Melis.

204
00:22:19,885 --> 00:22:22,684
Your sons have Vyrmax,
Arrax and Tyraxes.

205
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:24,508
Bela has Moondancer.

206
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:26,372
Daemon, none of our
dragons have been to war.

207
00:22:26,397 --> 00:22:28,836
There are also
unclaimed dragons.

208
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,479
Seasmoke still
resides on Drithmar.

209
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,098
Vermithor and Silverwind
dwell on the Dragon Mound.

210
00:22:33,458 --> 00:22:34,786
Still riderless.

211
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:36,719
Then there are the
three wild dragons,

212
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,919
all of whom nest here.

213
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,079
And who is to ride them?

214
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,768
Dragonstone has
13 to their four.

215
00:22:42,126 --> 00:22:45,245
I also have a score of eggs
incubating in the Dragon Mound.

216
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:46,469
No.

217
00:22:46,494 --> 00:22:49,853
We need a place to
gather, a toehold,

218
00:22:49,878 --> 00:22:52,157
large enough to
house a sizable host.

219
00:22:52,182 --> 00:22:54,061
Here, at Harrenhal,
we cut off the west,

220
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:55,805
surround King's Landing
with the dragons,

221
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:57,630
and we could have every
green head mounted on spikes

222
00:22:57,654 --> 00:22:59,613
before the fucking moon turns.

223
00:22:59,638 --> 00:23:02,977
Your Grace, a ship has
been sighted offshore.

224
00:23:03,002 --> 00:23:05,517
A lone galleon flying a banner
of a three-headed green dragon.

225
00:23:05,542 --> 00:23:07,634
Alert the watchtowers,
sight the skies.

226
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:45,525
I come at the behest
of the dowager...

227
00:23:45,550 --> 00:23:48,895
Queen Alicent, mother of King
Aegon, second of his name,

228
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,407
lord and protector of
the Seven Kingdoms.

229
00:23:52,243 --> 00:23:55,615
I've been directed to deliver her
message only to Princess Rhaenyra.

230
00:23:57,046 --> 00:23:59,259
Where is the princess?

231
00:24:51,165 --> 00:24:52,876
Princess Reneira.

232
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:59,446
I'm Queen Rhaenyra now, and you
all are traitors to the realm.

233
00:24:59,655 --> 00:25:03,907
King Aegon Targaryen,
second of his name.

234
00:25:04,856 --> 00:25:09,813
In his wisdom and desire for
peace, he's offering terms.

235
00:25:11,999 --> 00:25:16,579
Acknowledge Aegon as king and swear
obeisance before the Iron Throne.

236
00:25:16,604 --> 00:25:20,446
In exchange, his grace will confirm
your possession of Dragonstone.

237
00:25:20,925 --> 00:25:24,165
It will pass to your true-born
son, Jocerys, upon your death.

238
00:25:24,370 --> 00:25:27,610
Locerys will be confirmed as
the legitimate heir to Driftmark

239
00:25:27,635 --> 00:25:30,275
and all the lands and
holdings of House Velaryon.

240
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,180
Your sons, by Prince Daemon,

241
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:35,405
will also be given places
of high honour at court.

242
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,720
Aegon the Younger as
the king's squire,

243
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,680
Viserys as his cup-bearer.

244
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,800
Finally, the king,
in his good grace,

245
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,290
will pardon any knight or lord
who conspired against his assent.

246
00:25:46,587 --> 00:25:49,359
I would rather feed
my sons to the dragons

247
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,359
and have them carry
shields and caps

248
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:56,087
for your drunken
usurper cunt of a king.

249
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:59,360
Aegon Targaryen sits
the Iron Throne.

250
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,359
He wears the Conqueror's crown,

251
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,359
wields the Conqueror's sword,

252
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,095
has the Conqueror's name.
WWW.MY-SUBS.CO

253
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:08,491
He was anointed by a
septon of the faith

254
00:26:08,516 --> 00:26:10,359
before the eyes of thousands.

255
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,359
Every symbol of
legitimacy belongs to him.

256
00:26:16,149 --> 00:26:22,615
And then there is Stark, Tully, Baratheon,
houses that have also received and are at

257
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:26,907
present considering generous
terms from their king.

258
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:35,048
Stark, Tully, and Baratheon all swore to
me when King Viserys named me his heir.

259
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:39,713
Stale oaths will not put you
on the Iron Throne, princess.

260
00:26:40,195 --> 00:26:43,920
Succession changed the day
your father sired a son.

261
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:46,135
I only regret that
you and he were

262
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,107
the last to see the truth of it.

263
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:52,935
You are no more hand than Eggald
his king, fucking traitor.

264
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:05,690
Grand Maester.

265
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:12,135
What the fuck is this?

266
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:30,840
Queen Alicent has not forgotten the
love you once had for each other.

267
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,840
No blood need be spilled. The
realm can carry on in peace.

268
00:27:40,471 --> 00:27:42,839
Queen Alicent eagerly
awaits your answer.

269
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,268
She can have her answer now, stuffed in her
father's mouth along with his withered cock.

270
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:47,752
Let's end this mum as far as...

271
00:27:49,649 --> 00:27:53,173
Sir Eric, bring me Lord Hightower
so I may take the pleasure myself.

272
00:27:57,432 --> 00:27:58,640
No.

273
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:12,769
King's Landing will have my
answer on them on the morning.

274
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,640
It's no easy thing for a
man to be a dragon slayer.

275
00:28:37,394 --> 00:28:40,105
But dragons can kill
dragons and have.

276
00:28:41,093 --> 00:28:44,371
The simple truth is this, we
have more dragons than Aegon.

277
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:48,051
Viserys spoke often of the Valyrian
histories. I know them well.

278
00:28:48,662 --> 00:28:53,418
When dragons flew to
war, everything burned.

279
00:28:55,037 --> 00:28:58,024
I do not wish to rule over
a kingdom of ash and bone.

280
00:28:58,049 --> 00:29:01,432
Are you considering the High
Tower's terms, Your Grace?

281
00:29:01,457 --> 00:29:05,082
As Queen, what is my true duty
to the realm, Lord Bartimus?

282
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:09,993
Ensuring peace and unity, or that I
sit the Iron Throne no matter the cost?

283
00:29:10,018 --> 00:29:11,150
What's your father talking?

284
00:29:11,175 --> 00:29:12,747
My father's dead.

285
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:16,230
And he chose me
as his successor.

286
00:29:18,526 --> 00:29:20,960
To defend the realm, not
cast it headlong into war.

287
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:23,384
The enemy have declared war.

288
00:29:23,409 --> 00:29:25,008
What are you going
to do about it?

289
00:29:28,082 --> 00:29:29,835
Clear the room.

290
00:29:58,523 --> 00:30:00,439
Does the promise
of war excite you?

291
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,159
It cannot bend the
knee to the Hightowers.

292
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,759
They stole your birthright.

293
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,359
If you could take
the Iron Throne

294
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,759
without putting Otto Hightower's
head on a spike, would you?

295
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,919
Are you not angry?

296
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,359
Well, I should declare
war because I'm angry.

297
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,319
No, because it's your duty
as queen to crush rebellion.

298
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,840
You know my oath reaches
beyond our personal ambitions.

299
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,280
A song of ice and fire.

300
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,014
What?

301
00:30:26,459 --> 00:30:30,279
The coming war against the darkness
in the north will conquer his dream.

302
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:33,280
But Serah shared it with me
when he named to me Er...

303
00:30:37,225 --> 00:30:41,225
My brother was a slave to
his own man's importance.

304
00:30:42,209 --> 00:30:46,209
Anything to make his feckless
reign appear to have purpose.

305
00:30:49,178 --> 00:30:51,178
Dreams didn't make us kings.

306
00:30:51,912 --> 00:30:53,362
Dragons did.

307
00:31:10,357 --> 00:31:12,018
I never told you.

308
00:31:15,557 --> 00:31:17,586
Did you hear?

309
00:31:52,867 --> 00:31:56,720
I've had men whipped for
falling asleep on their watch.

310
00:32:02,738 --> 00:32:04,467
You are no man.

311
00:32:08,983 --> 00:32:14,257
You abandoned me when
I most needed you,

312
00:32:15,121 --> 00:32:17,476
both our children
stolen from us.

313
00:32:18,768 --> 00:32:20,230
I needed you...

314
00:32:20,254 --> 00:32:21,937
Baylor and Reyna needed you,

315
00:32:21,962 --> 00:32:25,219
and you abandoned us for
more adventure at sea.

316
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,953
Us has always been your way.

317
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:30,890
I had no other place to turn.

318
00:32:32,422 --> 00:32:33,821
I'd lost everything.

319
00:32:33,846 --> 00:32:35,539
We. Last callers.

320
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:38,500
We.

321
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:53,120
I understand we have a new king.

322
00:32:53,145 --> 00:32:56,109
A stranger casts a long
shadow over this family.

323
00:33:02,522 --> 00:33:04,273
Your brother is also dead.

324
00:33:09,192 --> 00:33:12,071
In his haste to bury
you and claim your seat,

325
00:33:12,096 --> 00:33:14,473
he stood before the
king and denounced

326
00:33:14,498 --> 00:33:16,260
Lainore's sons as illegitimate.

327
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,660
Daemon took his head for it.

328
00:33:28,118 --> 00:33:31,678
Heedless ambition has always
been a Valarian weakness.

329
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,257
You were right, Rhaenys.

330
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:43,687
I reached too far,
and for nothing.

331
00:33:45,781 --> 00:33:50,297
Our pursuit of the Iron
Throne is at an end.

332
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,227
We shall declare for no one.

333
00:33:58,974 --> 00:34:01,030
We will retire to High tide...

334
00:34:01,055 --> 00:34:05,281
to becontent with
our grandchildren.

335
00:34:05,306 --> 00:34:08,484
Jace, Luke and Joff are
claimants to the throne.

336
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:13,828
Those boys will not be safe
so long as Aegon is king.

337
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,711
Rhaenyra was complicit
in our son's death.

338
00:34:20,414 --> 00:34:23,209
That girl destroys
everything she touches.

339
00:34:23,234 --> 00:34:27,805
That girl is holding the
realm together at present.

340
00:34:28,236 --> 00:34:32,945
Every man standing around the Painted Table
urges her to plunge the realm into war.

341
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:37,099
Rhaenyra is the only one
who's demonstrated restraint.

342
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:41,780
The purpose of all this is to build
great grounds, my dear lords, trick is...

343
00:34:41,805 --> 00:34:44,099
to put more of their men in
the ground than your own.

344
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:47,099
Easy words for a lord who commands
from the safety of his castle.

345
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,164
The Lord of the Tides,

346
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:51,099
Lord Corlys Velaryon,

347
00:34:52,012 --> 00:34:55,707
And his wife, the Princess
Rhaenys Targaryen.

348
00:35:06,186 --> 00:35:07,543
My lords.

349
00:35:07,943 --> 00:35:09,152
Lord Corlys.

350
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:13,230
Brings much relief to see
you hale and healthy again.

351
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,637
I'm very sorry about
your father, Princess.

352
00:35:18,434 --> 00:35:21,047
He was a good man.

353
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:32,985
Where is Damon?

354
00:35:33,009 --> 00:35:34,808
There were other concerns

355
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:36,802
which demanded the
Prince's attention...

356
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:49,189
you're declared allies?

357
00:35:50,169 --> 00:35:53,809
Yes too few to win
a war for the throne

358
00:35:55,067 --> 00:36:00,356
well we would also hope to have the
support of houses Aaron Baratheon and stuff

359
00:36:00,381 --> 00:36:03,184
Hope is the fool's ally.

360
00:36:04,354 --> 00:36:09,602
Both Arryn and Baratheon share blood with
my house, but all of them swore oaths to me.

361
00:36:09,627 --> 00:36:12,696
As did House Hightower,
if I remember.

362
00:36:12,721 --> 00:36:15,362
As did you, Lord Corlys.

363
00:36:28,924 --> 00:36:34,370
Your father's realm was
one of justice and honor.

364
00:36:35,402 --> 00:36:39,635
Our houses are bound by
common blood and common cause.

365
00:36:40,915 --> 00:36:43,627
This Hightower
treason cannot stand.

366
00:36:49,335 --> 00:36:52,963
You have the full support
of our fleet and house.

367
00:36:54,104 --> 00:36:56,057
Your grace.

368
00:37:03,974 --> 00:37:05,651
You honor me, Lord Corlys...

369
00:37:11,428 --> 00:37:12,737
Princess Rhaenys,

370
00:37:17,197 --> 00:37:20,549
but, as I said to my Bannermen

371
00:37:20,974 --> 00:37:24,737
I made a promise to my father to
hold the realm strong and united.

372
00:37:26,026 --> 00:37:29,322
If war's first stroke is to
fall, it will not be by my hand.

373
00:37:30,703 --> 00:37:32,202
You do not mean to act.

374
00:37:32,227 --> 00:37:33,596
Taking Caution...

375
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,620
does not mean standing fast...

376
00:37:35,644 --> 00:37:37,644
I wish to know who
my allies are...

377
00:37:38,221 --> 00:37:40,221
before I send them to war

378
00:37:47,783 --> 00:37:53,018
Consequence of my near
demise in the stepstones

379
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,900
Is that we now control them I?

380
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:59,049
Took care to fully garrison
the territory this time...

381
00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:02,055
a total blockade of the shipping
lanes will be in place in days

382
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:10,080
if not already the triarchy have
been routed the narrow sea is ours,

383
00:38:11,074 --> 00:38:13,808
if we further seal the gullet...

384
00:38:13,832 --> 00:38:18,167
we can cut off all seaborne travel
and trade to King's Landing.

385
00:38:18,808 --> 00:38:22,228
I should take Maylis and
patrol the gullet myself

386
00:38:26,033 --> 00:38:27,555
When we drain the Narrow Sea,

387
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:31,009
we can surround King's Landing,

388
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:35,753
lay siege to the Red Keep, and
force the Green's surrender.

389
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:39,297
If we're to have enough swords
to surround King's Landing,

390
00:38:39,322 --> 00:38:42,921
we must first secure the support of
Winterfell the Arian Storm's End.

391
00:38:42,946 --> 00:38:45,021
I'll prepare the
ravens, Your Grace.

392
00:38:45,487 --> 00:38:47,724
We should bear those mysteries.

393
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:53,217
Dragons can fly faster than ravens
and they're more convincing.

394
00:38:56,858 --> 00:38:58,146
Send us.

395
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,760
The prince is right, Your Grace.

396
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Very well.

397
00:39:12,557 --> 00:39:14,557
Prince Jocerys will fly north.

398
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,639
First to the Eyrie to see my
mother's cousin, the Lady Jane Allen.

399
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,560
And then to Winterfell to treat with Lord
Cragan Stark for the support of the North.

400
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,693
Prince Lucerys will fly south to Storm's
End and treat with Lord Boros Baratheon.

401
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,359
We must remind these lords
of the oaths they swore

402
00:39:35,178 --> 00:39:38,359
and the cost of breaking them.

403
00:40:01,346 --> 00:40:06,343
It's been said that as Targaryens,
we are closer to gods than to men.

404
00:40:08,265 --> 00:40:11,179
The Iron Throne puts us
a touch closer, perhaps.

405
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:16,360
But, if we are to serve
the Seven Kingdoms,

406
00:40:17,413 --> 00:40:19,260
we must answer to their gods.

407
00:40:20,387 --> 00:40:24,542
If you take this errand, you go
as messengers, not as warriors.

408
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:27,698
You must take no
part in any fighting.

409
00:40:29,181 --> 00:40:32,519
Swear it to me now, under
the eyes of the Seven.

410
00:40:37,547 --> 00:40:38,987
I swear it.

411
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,651
I swear it.

412
00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:47,260
Thank you.

413
00:40:50,193 --> 00:40:54,992
Cregan Stark is close to
your age, then to mine.

414
00:40:55,017 --> 00:40:59,034
I would hope that as men, we
can find some common interest.

415
00:40:59,568 --> 00:41:00,839
Yes, Your Grace.

416
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:12,060
Storm's End is a short
flight from here.

417
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,059
You have Baratheon blood
from your grandmother, Anise.

418
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:20,520
And Lord Boros is an
eternally proud man.

419
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:24,059
You'll be honoured to host
a prince of the realm.

420
00:41:24,871 --> 00:41:26,440
And his dragon.

421
00:41:34,778 --> 00:41:37,581
I expect you will receive
a very warm welcome.

422
00:41:39,128 --> 00:41:41,127
Yes, Mother. To Chris.

423
00:41:49,731 --> 00:41:51,245
Go to it, then.

424
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:18,700
For stratis, sigela, irudas,
anon, ose, arzuro, utunti,

425
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:39,983
isim, tos, laosi,
ae, ae, ae, ae.

426
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,740
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH...

427
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,059
I'm Princess Cerys Velaryon.

428
00:45:26,481 --> 00:45:28,722
I bring a message to Lord
Borys from the Queen.

429
00:45:44,895 --> 00:45:46,895
Prince Lucerius Velaryon.

430
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:56,079
Son of Princess
Runeira Targaryen.

431
00:46:00,232 --> 00:46:01,362
Loporos.

432
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:05,425
I brought you a
message from my mother.

433
00:46:06,412 --> 00:46:07,520
The Queen.

434
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,680
Yet earlier this day I received
an envoy from the King.

435
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,060
Which is it?

436
00:46:14,334 --> 00:46:17,059
King or Queen?

437
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:20,060
The House of the Dragon does
not seem to know who rules it.

438
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:25,035
What's your mother's message?

439
00:46:40,227 --> 00:46:42,650
Where's the bloody maester?

440
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:18,977
Remind me of my father's oath.

441
00:47:20,646 --> 00:47:22,565
King Agon at least
came with an offer.

442
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:25,310
My swords and banners
for a marriage pact.

443
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:28,517
If I do as your mother bids,

444
00:47:29,597 --> 00:47:32,181
which one of my
daughters will you wed?

445
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,640
Boy?

446
00:47:35,494 --> 00:47:38,861
My lord, I'm not free to marry.

447
00:47:39,798 --> 00:47:41,300
I'm already betrothed.

448
00:47:43,475 --> 00:47:45,744
So you come with empty hands.

449
00:47:47,786 --> 00:47:50,885
Go home, pup, and
tell your mother

450
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:53,149
that the Lord of Storm's
End is not some dog

451
00:47:53,174 --> 00:47:56,294
that she can whistle up at
me to set against her foes.

452
00:47:58,599 --> 00:48:02,236
I shall take your answer
to the Queen, my Lord.

453
00:48:08,055 --> 00:48:09,277
Wait.

454
00:48:11,291 --> 00:48:12,820
My Lord Strong.

455
00:48:17,775 --> 00:48:19,334
Did you really think

456
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,918
that you could just
fly about the realm,

457
00:48:21,943 --> 00:48:24,343
trying to steal my
brother's throne at no cost.

458
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:27,340
I will not fight you.

459
00:48:28,518 --> 00:48:31,397
I came as a messenger,
not a warrior.

460
00:48:31,422 --> 00:48:33,103
Fight would be little challenge.

461
00:48:35,841 --> 00:48:36,884
No;

462
00:48:37,717 --> 00:48:40,197
I want you to put out your eye.

463
00:48:42,322 --> 00:48:44,060
It's payment for mine.

464
00:48:46,165 --> 00:48:47,500
One will serve.

465
00:48:51,376 --> 00:48:52,907
I would not blind you.

466
00:48:55,853 --> 00:48:58,100
I plan to make a gift
of it to my mother.

467
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,149
No.

468
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,286
Then you are craven
as well as a traitor.

469
00:49:06,311 --> 00:49:07,195
Not here.

470
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:10,260
Give me your eye, or
I will take it, boss.

471
00:49:10,905 --> 00:49:12,559
Not in my hall.

472
00:49:13,270 --> 00:49:15,269
The boy came as an envoy.

473
00:49:15,294 --> 00:49:17,659
I'll not have blood
shed beneath my roof.

474
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:20,659
Take Prince Lucerys
back to his dragon.

475
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,052
Now!

476
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,700
Focus!

477
00:49:58,223 --> 00:50:00,223
Pay attention, Arrax!

478
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,754
Be calm!

479
00:50:01,778 --> 00:50:02,965
Listen!

480
00:50:02,989 --> 00:50:04,355
Obey!

481
00:50:09,611 --> 00:50:11,441
Fly, Arrax!

482
00:51:17,816 --> 00:51:19,816
Ahh.

483
00:51:20,037 --> 00:51:22,037
Ha Ha Ha.

484
00:51:45,306 --> 00:51:47,040
Quickly, Turn!

485
00:52:37,309 --> 00:52:39,759
You owe a debt.

486
00:52:41,063 --> 00:52:42,353
Boy!

487
00:52:46,415 --> 00:52:48,142
No, Arrax!

488
00:52:49,141 --> 00:52:51,742
No, Arrax! Serve me!

489
00:52:52,625 --> 00:52:55,297
Np, No, No, No, No, Baker!

490
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:56,666
No.

491
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:58,690
Serve me Baker! No.

492
00:53:20,956 --> 00:53:24,029
Baker! No! No!
