A marriage for love,

336
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:11,722
not for the crown.

00:25:36,747 --> 00:25:39,876

in exchange for a bushel of
oranges or a ship to Asshai?

to marry a nobleman from a great house

344
00:26:02,732 --> 00:26:04,525

make a fine husband.

my marriage...

347

Ser Criston,
Laenor and I have an understanding.

I've granted him leave
to pursue his own interests...

So you want me to be your whore?

352
