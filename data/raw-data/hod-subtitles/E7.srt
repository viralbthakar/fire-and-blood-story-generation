History does not remember blood.

170
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,964

173
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,704
Rhaenyra: Laenor has
been restless for years,

174
00:18:09,788 --> 00:18:13,492
but now, he will be useless.

175
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,627
Or worse.

176
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:22,217
I know better than anyone
that our marriage is a farce.

177
00:18:22,301 --> 00:18:26,071
But I at least make the effort
to maintain appearances.

178
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,341
You have more to lose.

179
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,946
Yes, well, that has been my lot
since my father named me heir.

180
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:38,016
We did try...

181
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:41,069
to conceive a child.

182
00:18:41,153 --> 00:18:45,424
We performed our duty as best we could.

183
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,695
But to no avail.

184
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,837
There was no joy in it.

185
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:04,843
I found that elsewhere.

186
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:10,349
- It felt good to be desired.
- Hm.

187
00:19:12,017 --> 00:19:15,487
I understand Ser Harwin was quite...

188
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,491
devoted to you.

189
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:23,128
Yes, he was.

190
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,565
And I trusted him.

191
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,803
Should've forbidden Ser Harwin
from returning to the Riverlands.

192
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,819
Harren's curse is said
to be as strong now

193
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:39,961
as it was after the Conquest.

194
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,413
That's a ghost story,

195
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,049
one Ser Otto and the Queen
would gladly exploit.

196
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:48,587
I do not believe Alicent
capable of cold murder.

197
00:19:49,755 --> 00:19:52,774
Mm.

198
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,327
Each of us is capable of depravity.

199
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:58,997
And more than you would believe.

200
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,269
I believe it of you.

201
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,249
If you're accusing me of some depravity,

202
00:20:08,273 --> 00:20:10,409
you'll need to be more specific.

203

I've been alone.

204
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:16,925
- You abandoned me.
- I spared you.

205
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,502
- You were a child.
- Yes.

206
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,170
Yes, I was a child.

207
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:25,023
And look at what my life
became without you.

208
00:20:26,692 --> 00:20:28,172
Droll tragedy.

209
00:20:28,292 --> 00:20:30,477
Oh, and I wonder what you
think of mine by comparison?

210
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,322
I know little of it.

211
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,405
Did you love her?

212
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,943
We were happy enough.

213
00:20:46,278 --> 00:20:49,047
Well, that in itself
is a great achievement.

214
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:56,788
- I am sorry.
- Don't be.

215
