2
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,272
You're sure?

3
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:18,114
With his own eyes, Your Grace.

4
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:28,333
Uh...

5
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,420
Stay here.
Tell, tell no one.

6
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:36,257
Help me dress.

7
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:52,523
Who knows?

8
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:57,654
My handmaiden, Talya.

9
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:01,616
Some of the servants.

10
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,580
I saw him last night...

11
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,626
before he--

12
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,965
He told me he wished
for Aegon to be king.

13
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,433
It is the truth.

14
00:04:28,351 --> 00:04:30,353
Uttered with his own lips.

15
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:34,023
His last words to me and I
was the only one to hear it.

16
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:36,693
And now he's dead.

17
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,934
What is it that could
not have waited an hour?

18
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,644
Was Dorne invaded?

19
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:16,941
The King is dead.

20
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:29,454
We grieve for Viserys the Peaceful...

21
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,331
our sovereign...

22
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,710
our friend.

23
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,382
But he has left us a gift.

24
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:49,098
With his last breath, he impressed
upon the Queen his final wish:

25
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,643
that his son, Aegon...

26
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,773
should succeed him
as Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

27
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:08,159
Then we may proceed now
with the full assurance

28
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:11,079
of his blessing on our long-laid plans.

29
00:06:11,162 --> 00:06:13,081
Yes.
There is much to be done,

30
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,707
as we've previously discussed.

31
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,834
Now, there are two among the captains

32
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,545
of the City Watch that
remain loyal to Daemon.

33
00:06:19,629 --> 00:06:22,298
Let us replace them.
Lord Lannister.

34
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,817
The Treasury is well in hand.

35
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,802
The gold will be divided
for safekeeping.

36
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:26,904
Let ravens be sent to our allies,

37
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,305
Riverrun and Highgarden.

38
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:30,866
Am I to understand that
members of the small council

39
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,602
have been planning secretly
to install my son without me?

40
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:38,231
My Queen, there was no need to
sully you with darkling schemes.

41
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:40,066
I will not have this.

42
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,193
To hear that you are plotting

43
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:45,363
to replace the King's chosen heir

44
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,590
- with an imposter!
- His firstborn son

45
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,659
- is hardly an imposter.
- Hundreds of lords

46
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,411
and landed knights
swore fealty to the Princess.

47
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,389
That was some 20 years ago.
Most of them now dead.

48
00:06:54,413 --> 00:06:55,808
You heard the Lord Hand.

49
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,126
Plot or no, the King changed his mind.

50
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,629
I am six-and-seventy years old.

51
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:06,175
I have known Viserys longer
than any who sit at this table.

52
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,778
And I will not believe
that he said this

53
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:13,933
on his deathbed, alone, with only
the, the boy's mother as a witness.

54
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,978
This is seizure!

55
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:19,480
It is theft!
It is treason!

56
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:23,359
- At the least, it is--
- Mind your tongue, Lyman.

57
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:25,903
The King was well last night...

58
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,613
by all accounts.

59
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:33,995
Which of you here can swear
that he died of his own accord?

60
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,790
Which of us are you accusing
of regicide, Lord Beesbury?

61
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,584
Whether it was one of you,

62
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,211
or all of you, I care not.

63
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:43,355
- I will have no part--
- Sit down!

64
00:07:43,379 --> 00:07:46,299
- Ahh!
- Ser Criston.

65
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:01,439
Throw down your sword and
remove your cloak, Ser Criston.

66
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:06,068
I am your Lord Commander, Ser Criston.

67
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,653
Cast down your sword.

68
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,240
I will not suffer insults
to Her Grace the Queen.

69
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,410
There was no insult to me, Ser Criston.
Y-- Put aside your blade.

70
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,504
- Has it come to this?
- Lord Commander, enough.

71
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:33,763
- Let us have Lord Beesbury removed.
- No.

72
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,099
The door remains shut
until we finish our business.

73
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,660
Storm's End is of concern.

74
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:59,121
We may not assume
the loyalty of Lord Borros.

75
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,916
But he has four daughters,
all of them unmarried.

76
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,086
- The right proposal--
- What of Rhaenyra?

77
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:08,965
The former heir cannot, of
course, be allowed to remain free

78
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:12,802
and draw support to her claim.

79
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,365
- You mean to imprison her.
- She and her family

80
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,681
will be given the opportunity

81
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:20,142
to publicly swear obeisance
to the new King.

82
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,144
She will never bend the knee.

83
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,981
Nor will Daemon, which you know.

84
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,988
You plan to kill them.

85
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:38,703
And all here accede to this.

86
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:41,122
Your father is correct, Your Grace.

87
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:44,834
A living challenger invites
battle and bloodshed.

88
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,836
It is unsavory, yes.

89
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,339
But a sacrifice we must make
to secure Aegon's succession.

90
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:53,342
And then there is Daemon to consider.

91
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,029
- The King wouldn't wish for any unsavory--
- But the King did not wish

92
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,848
for the murder of his daughter!

93
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,850
He loved her.
I will not have you deny this.

94
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:01,844
And yet--

95
00:10:01,857 --> 00:10:03,033
One more word,
and I will have you removed

96
00:10:03,096 --> 00:10:04,937
from this chamber and sent to the Wall!

97
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,409
What do you suggest, Your Grace?

98
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,747
Time is of the essence.

99
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,593
Lord Commander Westerling...

100
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,055
take your knights to Dragonstone.

101
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,973
Be quick and be clean.

102
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,841
I am Lord Commander of the Kingsguard.

103
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:03,746
I recognize no authority
but the King's.

104
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,665
And until there is one...

105
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,961
I have no place here.

106
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:23,766
It is our fate, I think,

107
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,769
to crave always what
is given to another.

108
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:31,148
If one possesses a thing,
the other will take it away.

109
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,317
Yes, Princess.

110
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,613
Where is Aegon?

111
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,618
N-Not here.

112
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:43,828
He's not in his rooms.

113
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:52,878
Father.

114
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,889
What's happened?

115
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:22,199
- Your father--
- There is a beast beneath the boards.

116
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,368
Oh, my dearest love.

117
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,183
Ser Erryk.

118
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,645
Where's the Prince?

119
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,440
Forgive me, Lord Hand.
I do not know.

120
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:57,860
But you're sworn to protect him.

121
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,695
He exploits his authority
to order me away,

122
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:01,018
and then he evades me, my Lord.

123
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:08,996
I believe he may have
left the Keep secretly,

124
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:10,748
gone into the city.

125
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:12,917
Find him.

126
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,715
Take no one else but your brother.

127
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:21,509
And remove your white cloaks.

128
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,352
None can know who you are
or what you seek...

129
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,722
including the Queen.

130
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:28,724
My Lord.

131
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:32,228
Bring him to me, and me alone,
Ser Erryk.

132
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,874
What is the meaning of this?

133
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,062
Guard. Guard!

134
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:32,496
Prince Aegon's not to be found
within the castle walls, Your Grace.

135
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,820
Your father has sent Ser Erryk
into the city to find him.

136
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:40,254
Ser Erryk knows Aegon.
He has the advantage.

137
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:50,097
I trust again to you, Ser Criston,

138
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,974
and to your loyalty.

139
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:55,644
Aegon must be found,
and he must be brought to me.

140
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,688
The very fate of the Seven
Kingdoms depends on it.

141
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,860
Everything you feel for me...
as your Queen.

142
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,656
I will not fail you.

143
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,800
I'll come with you.

144
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:12,036
That would not be my desire, Aemond.

145
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:16,999
- If anything has happened--
- Cole needs me, Mother.

146
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:20,336
Ser Erryk isn't the only one
who knows Aegon's doings.

147
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,340
Aegon brought me to the Street of Silk

148
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:49,907
on my thirteenth name day.

149
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,202
It was his duty as my brother, he said,

150
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,497
to ensure I was as educated as he was.

151
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,878
At least that's what
I understood him to mean.

152
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,133
I don't follow.

153
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:09,885
He said,
“Time to get it wet.”

154
00:16:09,968 --> 00:16:12,971
Every woman is an image of the Mother,

155
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,390
to be spoken of with reverence.

156
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,692
Sometime last night, we...

157
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:28,195
misplaced our drinking companion.

158
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,740
Knowing that he has been, in the past,
a patron of your fine establishment,

159
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:33,635
we thought to inquire here
as to his whereabouts.

160
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,993
And describe him.

161
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:38,831
That is a delicate matter.

162
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,582
You see, the man we seek

163
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,918
is the young Prince Aegon.

164
00:16:43,001 --> 00:16:46,505
I may trust, I hope,
in the discretion of your trade.

165
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,925
The Prince is not here.

166
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:54,722
Has he been here?
Earlier, perhaps?

167
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:58,851
- Quite a bit earlier. Years ago, in fact.
- But more recently?

168
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:03,856
He does not frequent
the Street of Silk.

169
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,108
His tastes are known to be...

170
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,403
less discriminating.

171
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,238
Meaning what?

172
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:17,828
I wish you luck, good Ser.
And my best to your friend.

173
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,961
How you've grown.

174
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,092
Hm.

175
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,804
Viserys amended his wishes.

176
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:37,848
It's as simple as that.

177
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,102
You once swore
your banners to Rhaenyra.

178
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,146
You must now

179
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:46,899
pledge them to the future king.

180
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:58,994
I must confer first
with my house on this matter.

181
00:17:59,077 --> 00:18:02,122
You'll not leave this room
without declaring your intention.

182
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,885
I am no oath breaker.

183
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,431
I will not bend the knee.

184
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:29,066
Anyone else?

185
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:45,124
House Fell...
keeps its sworn oath to the Princess.

186
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,629
Very well.

187
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,859
Long live the King.

188
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,778
Long live the King.

189
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:48,729
It seems you were
mistaken as to Aegon's habits.

190
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:51,440
He could be in
the hands of mercenaries,

191
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,983
on a ship to Yi Ti.

192
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,069
He could be dead.

193
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,434
Let us hope, for your mother's
sake, that is not the case.

194
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,939
Let's have a look.

195
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,508
- Go on.
- Come here. Come here!

196
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,386
Get in there, you little--

197
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:28,810
Yeah!

198
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,106
Come on!

199
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,156
How old are they?

200
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,785
About 10 years, I should say.

201
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:48,038
They have them grow their
nails and file the teeth.

202
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,456
Makes them more formidable.

203
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,054
Come on!

204
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,675
Prince Aegon spends many
a night in this place.

205
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:57,047
Do you see now what he is?

206
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,423
You've not seen everything.

207
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,977
- Aegon's?
- One of many, I'd wager.

208
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,746
Here I am, trawling the
city, ever the good soldier

209
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:33,333
in search of a wastrel who's never taken
half an interest in his birthright.

210
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:39,006
'Tis I the younger brother who
studies history and philosophy,

211
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:40,716
it is I who trains with the sword,

212
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:41,818
who rides the largest
dragon in the world.

213
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,219
It is I who should be--

214
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,684
I know what it is to toil for
what others are freely given.

215
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,519
Mm.

216
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,649
And we can't find him, Cole.

217
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,736
You are a decent man
with no taste for depravity.

218
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,738
His secrets are his own...

219
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,114
and he's welcome to them.

220
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,908
I'm next in line to the throne.

221
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,494
Should they come looking for me,

222
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,246
I intend to be found.

223
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,217
Something must be done.
Aegon is unfit to rule.

224
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:26,195
You tolerated the Prince's
proclivities for years.

225
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,137
Because it was my sworn duty, Arryk.

226
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,097
It's for the Hand to find wisdom.

227
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:32,267
We swore an oath
of service until death.

228
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:35,270
A moment of your time, m'lords.

229
00:22:35,353 --> 00:22:37,314
You'll find no buyers
for your wares here.

230
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,863
I can take you to Prince Aegon.

231
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,200
Rather, I am sent by one
who knows where he is.

232
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,443
Who'll tell you, for a price.

233
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:54,539
Deliver him,
and we'll consider your price.

234
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:59,503
My mistress will not treat with
the servants of the Keep...

235
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,339
exalted though they may be.

236
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,758
She'll trust this to
the Hand of the King only.

237
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,843
Impossible.

238
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:10,847
I think he will wish to hear
what the White Worm can tell him.

239
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:28,824
Halt! Hold the gate!

240
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,161
Let go of me!

241
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,955
He was fleeing from the gate.

242
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:35,831
Do you know who I am?

243
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,541
A warning for the Princess,

244
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,502
I'd wager.

245
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:41,711
What say you?

246
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,966
The Lord Confessor presumes.

247
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,970
I have no love for the Princess.

248
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:53,265
And where were you going then
with such urgency?

249
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:01,231
Let the King's Justice take him.

250
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:06,570
Let go of me!

251
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:09,406
- No! This is not right!
- You did well, Lord Larys.

252
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:13,243
- I will--
- Only my duty, my Lord Hand.

253
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,554
Who do you think you are?

254
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:16,788
You've spent many hours
with the Queen of late.

255
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:28,091
There's no reason those hours could
not, in the end, benefit you.

256
00:25:57,764 --> 00:26:00,934
I will do you the considerable
courtesy of assuming

257
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,936
there is a good reason for the outrage

258
00:26:03,019 --> 00:26:04,938
of my treatment here this morning.

259
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:08,525
My sincerest regrets
for the lack of ceremony.

260
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,280
The King.

261
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,162
And you are usurping the throne.

262
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,164
It was my husband's dying wish.

263
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,165
Believe it or no,

264
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:26,960
it is of no consequence.

265
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,336
Aegon will be king.

266
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,509
I came here to ask your support.

267
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:38,138
Well, I must credit you
for your boldness.

268
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:40,223
House Velaryon has long allied itself

269
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:42,600
with the Princess Rhaenyra
and what has it gained you?

270
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:47,897
Your daughter dead...
alone in Pentos.

271
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:50,775
Your son cuckolded.

272
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,111
Rhaenyra's heirs are none of yours.

273
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:59,367
It is your husband who grasps
so heedlessly for the throne.

274
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,244
And even he has abandoned you:

275
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,955
gone these six long years
to fight a desperate battle,

276
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:07,125
returning grievously,
if not mortally, wounded,

277
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:09,836
leaving the Lady of Driftmark
to chart her course alone.

278
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,550
The word of my house is not fickle.

279
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:20,764
No. But, dear cousin...

280
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:26,728
you more than any soul alive
understand what I say now.

281
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,438
Princess Rhaenys, I loved my husband,

282
00:27:28,521 --> 00:27:31,358
but I will speak
the truth we both know.

283
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,818
You should've been queen.

284
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:38,573
I little thought to hear
those words from you.

285
00:27:38,656 --> 00:27:40,634
The Iron Throne was yours
by blood and by temperament.

286
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:44,204
Viserys would've lived
his days a country lord,

287
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,206
content to hunt
and study his histories,

288
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,624
but... here we are.

289
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:51,628
We do not rule

290
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:55,131
but we may guide the men that do.

291
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,925
Gently...

292
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,302
away from violence and sure destruction

293
00:27:59,386 --> 00:28:02,180
- and instead toward peace.
- Ugh.

294
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,433
Is it in the name of peace
that you've imprisoned me?

295
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,685
- And what of my dragon?
- If we are overmatched,

296
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,105
Rhaenyra will be tempted to strike
us, and war will ensue.

297
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:15,276
Without your dragon,
she may be persuaded to negotiate.

298
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,739
If it's Driftmark you want,
you shall have it

299
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:24,244
for you and your granddaughters
to pass on as you see fit.

300
00:28:28,998 --> 00:28:30,708
You are wiser than
I believed you to be...

301
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:37,298
Alicent Hightower.

302
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,885
A true queen counts
the cost to her people.

303
00:28:42,095 --> 00:28:45,682
And yet you toil still
in service to men.

304
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,685
Your father, your husband, your son.

305
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,188
You desire not to be free,

306
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,358
but to make a window
in the wall of your prison.

307
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:59,904
Have you never imagined yourself...

308
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:03,032
on the Iron Throne?

309
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,129
I'll leave you with your thoughts.

310
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,842
Ring the bell when you have an answer.

311
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:46,618
My Prince.

312
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:59,839
You yourself are the mysterious
White Worm, I take it.

313
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:06,095
Or are you simply a further
peel in this stinking onion?

314
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,975
My condolences
on the passing of your king.

315
00:30:26,074 --> 00:30:27,408
Where is Prince Aegon?

316
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:34,165
I thought, the Prince is in Flea
Bottom where no one is to be trusted.

317
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,543
I'd best secrete him somewhere safe

318
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,379
in case they come looking for him.

319
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:41,589
Where's the Prince?

320
00:30:41,673 --> 00:30:44,259
He is safely tucked away.

321
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,222
I want an end to the savage use

322
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,349
of children in Flea Bottom.

323
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,686
They are forced to fight, and worse...

324
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,814
your gold cloaks take the
bribes given them to look away.

325
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,859
An obscenity

326
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,947
either tolerated
or ignored by the crown.

327
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,659
I'll look into it.

328
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,369
You have my word.

329
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,376
When your plots ripen

330
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,713
and you install your grandson
on the throne,

331
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:24,966
remember it was me who put him there.

332
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:30,013
I could have killed him
as easily as a wasp on fruit.

333
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:35,101
There is no power but what
the people allow you to take.

334
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,855
I will remember.

335
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,548
Listen.

336
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,767
No... No!

337
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,645
No! Agh!

338
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,488
Where is the White Worm?

339
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,798
She sold you for a price.

340
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,948
And why have you paid it?

341
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:35,787
I want my mother.

342
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,580
Your grandfather, the Hand,

343
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:39,582
will meet you outside the city walls.

344
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,276
You flee what other men
die seeking, Aegon.

345
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:07,985
I do regret this, friend.

346
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,602
No! Stop! No.

347
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:48,943
- I was hoping you disappeared.
- Is our father truly dead?

348
00:33:49,026 --> 00:33:51,320
Yes... and they're
going to make you king.

349
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,115
Agh!

350
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,284
- No!
- Are you going to help me?!

351
00:33:59,036 --> 00:34:01,497
No! Let me go!

352
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,623
Where's your brother, huh?

353
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,294
Let me go!

354
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,755
Brother! Ahh!

355
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,345
Let me go!

356
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,973
I have no wish to rule!

357
00:34:19,056 --> 00:34:21,684
No taste for duty!
I'm not suited.

358
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,269
You'll get no argument from me.

359
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:27,065
You let me go,
I will find a ship and sail away,

360
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,232
never to be found.

361
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:33,863
The Queen awaits.

362
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,814
- Well played.
- None of this is a game.

363
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,024
And yet you treat it as one.

364
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,068
A charming contest,

365
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:16,948
the... prize,
a pouch of silver.

366
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,746
We have relied on one
another these many years.

367
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:28,626
And now it is the good of the
family that we both desire.

368
00:35:28,709 --> 00:35:31,963
Whatever our differences,
our hearts remain as one.

369
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,842
Our hearts were never one.

370
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,552
I see that now.

371
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,488
Rather, I have been a piece
that you moved about the board.

372
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:45,852
If that is true, then I made
you Queen of the Seven Kingdoms.

373
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:50,064
- Would you have desired it otherwise?
- How could I know?

374
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:53,150
I wanted whatever you
impressed upon me to want.

375
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,196
And now the debt comes due.

376
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,241
- A debt you were happy enough to pay.
- A sacrifice.

377
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:05,079
A sacrifice made for
the stability of the realm.

378
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,248
No king has ever lived
that hasn't had to forfeit

379
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,417
the lives of a few to protect the many.

380
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,711
Though I understand your squeamishness.

381
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:15,298
Reluctance to murder is not a weakness!

382
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:19,844
I have Aegon.

383
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:22,555
We'll proceed now as I see fit.

384
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,481
We will send terms
to Rhaenyra on Dragonstone.

385
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:35,610
True terms, such that she
may accept without shame.

386
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,447
If she lives, her allies
will mass behind her banners,

387
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,158
- looking for her return.
- Then she must not return.

388
00:36:43,534 --> 00:36:45,178
My husband would have
desired this mercy be shown

389
00:36:45,202 --> 00:36:47,955
- to his daughter.
- Your husband?

390
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,791
Or you, his daughter's
childhood companion?

391
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,424
Criston Cole will be named Lord
Commander of the Kingsguard.

392
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:02,553
My son will be anointed
tomorrow at dawn.

393
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:06,140
The whole of King's Landing
must witness his ascent.

394
00:37:06,223 --> 00:37:09,852
He will assume authority.
There will be no more dithering.

395
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,355
My son will take the crown of his
namesake, the Conqueror,

396
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,523
and carry Blackfyre, his sword.

397
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:18,069
Let the people remember the ancient
strength of House Targaryen.

398
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,159
You look so much like your
mother in certain lights.

399
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:37,588
As you wish.

400
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:51,394
Your Grace.

401
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:58,401
The hour is late, Lord Larys.

402
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:01,404
I've found out something
that you should know.

403
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:17,294
Have you asked yourself, I wonder...

404
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,672
how it is...

405
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,424
that your father, the Hand...

406
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,845
found Aegon first?

407
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,423
There is a web of spies
at work in the Red Keep.

408
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:07,386
Along its threads travels news
of all our doings.

409
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:12,933
Your father knows this,
but has left it in place.

410
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,479
More than once, it has proved
advantageous to those willing to...

411
00:39:18,064 --> 00:39:20,357
feed the weaver.

412
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:23,736
And this weaver watches me?

413
00:39:25,738 --> 00:39:27,782
Um...

414
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:53,140
One of the little spiders
is your lady-in-waiting.

415
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,937
- Talya?
- There are more like her.

416
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,147
Even I do not know their number.

417
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:08,989
There is one way
to destroy his advantage.

418
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:12,034
It must be taken out at the head.

419
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:18,707
When the Queen dies,
the bees fly without purpose.

420
00:40:20,417 --> 00:40:23,420
Begging your pardon for the
turn of phrase, Your Grace.

421
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:28,717
I assume this task falls
within your expertise.

422
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,846
If you wish it...

423
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,639
it will be done.

424
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,262
Out of my way!

425
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,312
With me, Princess.

426
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:05,940
I cannot let this treachery stand.

427
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:48,607
- Where are we?
- Just south of King's Way.

428
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:51,610
The Blackwater's this way.

429
00:43:20,681 --> 00:43:23,267
I won't leave Meleys.

430
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:24,494
- If I could get to the Dragonpit, then--
- No.

431
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,228
They'll expect you there, Princess.

432
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,189
You won't get past the gates.

433
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:31,358
Now come.

434
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,569
You must make for the
riverfront and find a ship.

435
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,404
Before they know you've gone.

436
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:37,573
Move it! Go! Go!

437
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,116
This way!

438
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,869
Keep moving! That's right.

439
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,245
That's right!

440
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:46,290
- Onward!
- This way.

441
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:49,251
Halt! Halt!

442
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,714
Keep moving!

443
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,180
All of you, move forward!

444
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,060
Keep moving!

445
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,866
Out of the way!

446
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,910
Out of the way!

447
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:39,218
Hyah! Hyah!

448
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:45,766
Have the decency to look grateful.

449
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,395
Do you know what has been
done to give you this day?

450
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,525
In an hour, you will be king.

451
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:57,444
- And my father never wanted this.
- That's not true.

452
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,613
He had 20 years to name me heir
and never did.

453
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:02,533
Steadfastly, he upheld
Rhaenyra's claim.

454
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:05,702
- He changed his mind.
- Oh.

455
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:08,330
No...

456
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:12,334
He could have, but he never did

457
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:13,836
because he didn't like me.

458
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,589
And yet, with his final breath,

459
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,193
he whispered to me that you should
take his place on the throne.

460
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:44,366
- Do not toy with me, Mother.
- I speak the truth.

461
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,300
Listen to me, Aegon.

462
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,735
Your grandfather, the Hand,
will try to impress on you

463
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,471
that Rhaenyra should be
put to the sword.

464
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,682
You must reject this counsel.

465
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:10,642
We must not rule with
cruelty and callousness.

466
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:12,561
For all her faults, she is your sister,

467
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,147
- your, your father's daughter--
- Do you love me?

468
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,402
You imbecile.

469
00:46:20,486 --> 00:46:23,071
Make way for the royal wheelhouse!

470
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,173
Hey, hey, forward then.

471
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:45,302
Go on, move yourself! Come on!

472
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:49,449
People of King's Landing...

473
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:52,286
today is the saddest of days.

474
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:56,123
Our beloved king...

475
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:58,792
Viserys the Peaceful...

476
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:01,587
is dead.

477
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:11,430
But it is also the most
joyous of days...

478
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:15,183
for as his spirit left us...

479
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,687
he whispered his final wish:

480
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:23,900
that his firstborn son, Aegon...

481
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,529
should succeed him.

482
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,750
Guards!

483
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:43,503
Out of the way! Move!

484
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,221
Halt!

485
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,640
Turn!

486
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,859
Present...

487
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:08,987
arms!

488
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:43,605
It is your great
good fortune and privilege

489
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:46,108
to be here to witness this:

490
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,570
a new day for our city...

491
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,573
a new day for our realm.

492
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:58,829
A new king... to lead us.

493
00:50:56,303 --> 00:51:00,056
May the Warrior give him courage.

494
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:07,481
May the Smith lend strength
to his sword and shield.

495
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:12,652
May the Father defend him in his need.

496
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:19,868
May the Crone lift her shining lamp

497
00:51:19,951 --> 00:51:23,246
and light his way to wisdom.

498
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:49,022
The crown of the Conqueror,

499
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:51,149
passed down through generations.

500
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:11,670
Let the Seven bear witness:

501
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,548
Aegon Targaryen is the true
heir to the Iron Throne.

502
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:55,171
All hail His Grace, Aegon,

503
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,090
Second of his Name,

504
00:52:57,173 --> 00:53:00,760
King of the Andals and the
Rhoynar and the First Men,

505
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,179
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms

506
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:05,932
and Protector of the Realm.

507
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:10,687
Aegon the King!

508
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,210
Aegon the King! Long live Aegon!

509
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,650
Open the doors!

510
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,951
Open the doors!

511
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,166
Get Helaena.

512
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:46,109
