1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,470
As the first century
of the Targaryen dynasty

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,990
came to a close

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,470
the health of the Old King,
Jaehaerys, was failing.

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,390
In those days, House Targaryen
stood at the height of its strength

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:24,270
with ten adult dragons under its yoke.

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:27,550
No power in the world
could stand against it.

7
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:31,350
King Jaehaerys reigned
over nearly 60 years

8
00:00:31,429 --> 00:00:33,270
of peace and prosperity

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,350
but tragedy had claimed both his sons

10
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:38,510
leaving his succession in doubt.

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,470
So, in the year 101

12
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:45,390
the Old King called a Great
Council to choose an heir.

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,990
Over a thousand lords made
the journey to Harrenhal.

14
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:54,070
Fourteen succession claims were heard

15
00:00:54,669 --> 00:00:57,230
but only two were truly considered.

16
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:01,870
Princess Rhaenys Targaryen,
the King's eldest descendant

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,470
and her younger cousin,
Prince Viserys Targaryen

18
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:08,190
the King's eldest male descendant.

19
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:18,070
It is declared by all lords paramount

20
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,310
and lords vassal of the Seven Kingdoms

21
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:29,470
that Prince Viserys Targaryen
be made Prince of Dragonstone!

22
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:35,030
Rhaenys, a woman, would
not inherit the Iron Throne.

23
00:01:37,589 --> 00:01:39,790
The lords instead chose Viserys

24
00:01:41,350 --> 00:01:42,750
my father.

25
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:47,910
Jaehaerys called the Great Council

26
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:51,230
to prevent a war being
fought over his succession.

27
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:53,510
For he knew the cold truth.

28
00:01:53,589 --> 00:01:57,950
The only thing that could tear
down the House of the Dragon

29
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,710
was itself.

31
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,470
Dohaeras, Syrax!

32
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:54,149
Umbas.

33
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,590
Rybas!

34
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:11,110
Welcome back, Princess. I
trust your ride was pleasant.

35
00:04:11,189 --> 00:04:13,029
Try not to look too relieved, ser.

36
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:14,470
I am relieved.

37
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,270
Every time that golden beast
brings you back unspoiled

38
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,390
it saves my head from a spike.

39
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,350
Syrax is growing quickly.

40
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,270
She'll soon be as large as Caraxes.

41
00:04:24,429 --> 00:04:26,310
That's almost large
enough to saddle two.

42
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:29,230
I believe I'm quite content
as a spectator, thank you.

43
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:34,150
Dohaeras.

44
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:36,629
Naejot!

45
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,310
Rhaenyra.

46
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,830
You know I don't like you to go flying

47
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:07,390
while I'm in this condition.

48
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:09,869
You don't like me to go flying
while you're in any condition.

49
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:14,550
- Your Grace.
- Good morrow, Alicent.

50
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,790
Did you sleep?

51
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,750
- I slept.
- How long?

52
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,990
I don't need mothering, Rhaenyra.

53
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,230
Well, here you are,
surrounded by attendants

54
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:24,830
all focused on the babe.

55
00:06:25,589 --> 00:06:27,430
Someone has to attend to you.

56
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:32,750
You will lie in this bed
soon enough, Rhaenyra.

57
00:06:33,189 --> 00:06:36,389
This discomfort is
how we serve the realm.

58
00:06:36,469 --> 00:06:39,510
I'd rather serve as a knight
and ride to battle and glory.

59
00:06:42,309 --> 00:06:44,430
We have royal wombs, you and I.

60
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,230
The child bed is our battlefield.

61
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,550
We must learn to face
it with a stiff lip.

62
00:06:54,349 --> 00:06:55,950
Now take a bath.

63
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,950
You stink of dragon.

64
00:07:00,269 --> 00:07:01,605
So, I said to him, "Well, I believe

65
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,590
you might be looking up the wrong end."

66
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,710
My lords.

67
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:10,326
The growing alliance
among the Free Cities

68
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,550
has taken to styling
itself the Triarchy.

69
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,750
They have massed on Bloodstone

70
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,406
and are presently
ridding the Step stones

71
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,870
of its pirate infestation.

72
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:21,470
Well, that sounds suspiciously
like good news, Lord Corlys.

73
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,510
A man called Craghas Drahar

74
00:07:23,589 --> 00:07:26,430
has styled himself the
prince-admiral of this Triarchy.

75
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,310
They call him the Crabfeeder

76
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:32,750
due to his inventive methods
of punishing his enemies.

77
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,190
And are we meant to
weep for dead pirates?

78
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:38,230
- No, Your Grace.
- Rhaenyra, you're late.

79
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,950
The King's cupbearer must not be late.

80
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,790
- Leaves people wanting for cups.
- I was visiting Mother.

81
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:46,590
On dragon back?

82
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,430
Hey, Your Grace, at
Prince Daemon's urging

83
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:51,950
the crown has invested
significant capital

84
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:55,349
in the re-training and
re-equipping of his City Watch.

85
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:59,470
I thought you might urge your brother
to fill his seat on the council

86
00:07:59,549 --> 00:08:02,230
and provide an
assessment of his progress

87
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,270
as commander of the Watch.

88
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:06,710
Do you think Daemon is
distracted by his present tasks?

89
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,830
And that his thoughts
and energies are occupied?

90
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:12,029
Well, one would hope so,
considering the associated costs.

91
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:15,230
Then let us all consider your
gold well-invested, Lord Beesbury.

92
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:18,270
I would urge that you not allow
this Triarchy much latitude

93
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:19,910
in the Step stones, Your Grace.

94
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,470
If those shipping lanes should
fall, it will beggar our ports.

95
00:08:23,549 --> 00:08:26,190
The crown has heard
your report, Lord Corlys

96
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:28,190
and takes it under advisement.

97
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:36,950
Shall we discuss the Heir's
Tournament, Your Grace?

98
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,430
I would be delighted.

99
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,485
Will the maesters' name
day prediction hold, Mellos?

100
00:08:41,509 --> 00:08:44,950
You must understand that these
things are mere estimations, my King

101
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:48,270
but we have all been
poring over the moon charts

102
00:08:48,349 --> 00:08:51,950
and we feel that our forecast
is as accurate as it can be.

103
00:08:52,029 --> 00:08:54,629
The cost of the tournament
is not negligible.

104
00:08:54,710 --> 00:08:58,950
Perhaps we might delay
until the child is in hand?

105
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:00,309
Most of the lords and knights

106
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:02,126
are certainly on their way
to King's Landing already.

107
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:03,375
- To turn them back now...
- The tourney will take

108
00:09:03,389 --> 00:09:04,789
the better part of a week.

109
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,710
Before the games are
over, my son will be born

110
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:09,350
and the whole realm will celebrate.

111
00:09:09,429 --> 00:09:12,469
We have no way of predicting
the sex of the child.

112
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:15,110
Of course, no maester's
capable of rendering an opinion

113
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:16,629
free of conditions, are they now?

114
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,710
There's a boy in the Queen's belly.

115
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,550
I know it.

116
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:24,629
And my heir will soon put all of this

117
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:26,830
damnable hand-wringing to rest himself.

118
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:32,230
He passed through the Red
Keep's gates at first light.

119
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:33,910
Does my father know he's here?

120
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,310
- No.
- Good.

121
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,710
Gods be good.

122
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:46,550
It's all right, ser.

123
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,112
_

124
00:09:57,232 --> 00:09:58,615
_

125
00:09:58,735 --> 00:10:01,475
_

126
00:10:01,595 --> 00:10:03,925
_

127
00:10:04,913 --> 00:10:07,469
_

128
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:08,630
Aye.

129
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,871
_

130
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:14,675
_

131
00:10:14,795 --> 00:10:18,432
_

132
00:10:18,822 --> 00:10:20,495
_

133
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:21,813
Mm.

134
00:10:21,933 --> 00:10:24,064
_

135
00:10:24,836 --> 00:10:27,473
_

136
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:30,818
_

137
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:33,145
_

138
00:10:33,265 --> 00:10:34,810
_

139
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,390
I bought you something.

140
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:45,990
Do you know what it is?

141
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,910
It's Valyrian steel.

142
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:51,710
Like Dark Sister.

143
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,430
Turn around.

144
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:11,430
Now

145
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:16,230
you and I both own a small
piece of our ancestry.

146
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,630
- Did you read it?
- Of course, I read it.

147
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,950
When Princess Nymeria arrived in Dorne

148
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,750
who did she take to husband?

149
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,150
A man.

150
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:35,670
What was his name?

151
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,190
Lord Something.

152
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,830
If you answer with "Lord Something,"
Septa Marlow will be furious.

153
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,870
She's funny when she's furious.

154
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,230
You're always like this
when you're worried.

155
00:11:48,309 --> 00:11:49,749
Like what?

156
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:51,230
Disagreeable.

157
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,230
You're worried your father
is about to overshadow you

158
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,510
with a son.

159
00:11:58,589 --> 00:12:00,309
I only worry for my mother.

160
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,630
I hope for my father that he gets a son.

161
00:12:04,549 --> 00:12:06,829
As long as I can recall,
it's all he's wanted.

162
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,470
You want him to have a son?

163
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:11,670
I want to fly with you on dragon back

164
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,325
see the great wonders
across the Narrow Sea

165
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:14,550
and eat only cake.

166
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:16,990
- I'm being serious.
- I never jest about cake.

167
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,190
You aren't worried about your position?

168
00:12:19,269 --> 00:12:22,030
I like this position.
It's quite comfortable.

169
00:12:25,549 --> 00:12:26,710
Where are you going?

170
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,190
Home. The hour has grown late.

171
00:12:29,870 --> 00:12:33,830
Princess Nymeria led her Rhoynar
across the Narrow Sea on 10,000 ships

172
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,870
to flee their Valyrian pursuers.

173
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,910
She took Lord Mors
Martell of Dorne to husband

174
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,790
and burned her own fleet off Sun spear

175
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,350
to show her people that
they were finished running.

176
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,950
- What are you doing?
- So you remember.

177
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:51,070
- If the Septa sees this book then...
- Fuck the Septa.

178
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:52,509
Rhaenyra!

179
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,030
Is it healing?

180
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:08,910
It has grown slightly, Your Grace.

181
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,910
Can you say yet what it is?

182
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,150
We've sent inquiries to the Citadel.

183
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:17,270
They are searching the
texts for similar cases.

184
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:19,710
It's a small cut from
sitting the throne.

185
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:21,150
It's nothing.

186
00:13:21,629 --> 00:13:23,509
The King has been under heavy stresses

187
00:13:23,589 --> 00:13:25,309
preparing for the birth.

188
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,510
Bad humors of the mind can
adversely affect the body.

189
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:33,710
Whatever it is, it
needs to be kept quiet.

190
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,510
We should leech it again, maester.

191
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,230
It's a wound that refuses
to heal, Grand Maester.

192
00:13:42,389 --> 00:13:44,030
Might I suggest cauterization?

193
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,110
Cauterization would be a wise
course of treatment, Your Grace.

194
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,990
- It will be painful...
- Fine.

195
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:52,590
Fine.

196
00:14:04,910 --> 00:14:07,350
You spend more time in that
bath than I do on the throne.

197
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:11,870
This is the only place I
can find comfort these days.

198
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,190
It's tepid.

199
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:17,950
It's as warm as the maesters will allow.

200
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,070
Don't they know dragons prefer heat?

201
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:23,709
After this miserable pregnancy

202
00:14:24,389 --> 00:14:27,270
I wouldn't be surprised if
I hatched an actual dragon.

203
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:29,750
And he will be loved and cherished.

204
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:33,710
Rhaenyra has already declared
that she is to have a sister.

205
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:34,950
Really?

206
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:38,150
- She even named her.
- Dare I ask?

207
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,310
Visenya.

208
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,285
She chose a dragon's egg for the cradle

209
00:14:42,309 --> 00:14:44,030
that she said reminded her of Vhagar.

210
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:45,510
Gods be good.

211
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,830
This family already has its Visenya.

212
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:52,430
Has there been any word
from your dear brother?

213
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:55,189
Not since I named him
Commander of the City Watch.

214
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,270
I'm sure he will
reemerge for the tourney.

215
00:14:58,990 --> 00:15:01,270
He could never stay away from the lists.

216
00:15:01,349 --> 00:15:02,630
The tourney

217
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:05,710
to celebrate the firstborn son
that we presently do not have.

218
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:08,670
You do understand

219
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,510
nothing will cause
the babe to grow a cock

220
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:12,549
if it does not already possess one?

221
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:14,710
This child is a boy, Aemma.

222
00:15:15,429 --> 00:15:16,949
I'm certain of it.

223
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:19,870
I've never been more
certain of anything.

224
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:24,630
The dream.

225
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,510
It was clearer than a memory.

226
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,190
Our son was born wearing
Aegon's iron crown.

227
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,470
When I heard the sound
of thundering hooves

228
00:15:37,549 --> 00:15:40,630
splintering shields, and ringing swords

229
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:43,350
and I placed our son
upon the Iron Throne

230
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,545
as the bells of the Grand Sept tolled

231
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:49,390
and all the dragons roared as one.

232
00:15:52,669 --> 00:15:54,829
Born wearing a crown?

233
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:58,830
Gods spare me, birth is
unpleasant enough as it is.

234
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:10,870
This is the last time, Viserys.

235
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:16,350
I've lost one babe in the
cradle, had two stillbirths

236
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:19,630
and two pregnancies ended
well before their term.

237
00:16:22,109 --> 00:16:24,709
That's five in twice as many years.

238
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,190
I know it is my duty
to provide you an heir

239
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,630
and I'm sorry if I
have failed you in that.

240
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,910
I am.

241
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:39,030
But I've mourned all
the dead children I can.

242
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,350
Commander on the floor!

243
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,230
When I took command of the
Watch, you were stray mongrels

244
00:17:12,669 --> 00:17:14,750
starving and undisciplined.

245
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:19,910
Now, you're a pack of hounds.

246
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:22,910
You're sated and honed for the hunt.

247
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:29,150
My brother's city has
fallen into squalor.

248
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:33,870
Crime of every breed has
been allowed to thrive.

249
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:36,909
No longer.

250
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:37,990
Beginning tonight

251
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:40,950
King's Landing will learn
to fear the color gold.

252
00:18:25,349 --> 00:18:26,710
Get up!

253
00:18:45,710 --> 00:18:46,870
Raper!

254
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,190
No! No... no!

255
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,910
Thief!

256
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,230
No!

257
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,110
Murderer!

258
00:19:25,150 --> 00:19:28,230
It was an unprecedented roundup
of criminals of every ilk.

259
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:30,150
Your brother made a public show of it

260
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:33,030
meting out the summary
judgments himself.

261
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,190
I'm told they needed a two-horse cart

262
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:39,310
to haul away the resulting
dismemberments when it was done.

263
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:41,390
Gods be good.

264
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:43,225
The Prince cannot be allowed

265
00:19:43,226 --> 00:19:46,430
to act with this kind
of unchecked impunity.

266
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:50,390
- Brother.
- Daemon.

267
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,989
Carry on. You were saying
something about my impunity.

268
00:19:57,389 --> 00:20:00,709
You are to explain your
doings with the City Watch.

269
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:04,350
Your new gold cloaks

270
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,365
made quite the impression
last night, didn't they?

271
00:20:06,389 --> 00:20:07,389
Did they?

272
00:20:07,469 --> 00:20:10,550
The City Watch is not a sword
to be wielded at your whim.

273
00:20:10,629 --> 00:20:12,509
They're an extension of the crown.

274
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:14,470
The Watch was enforcing
the crown's laws.

275
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,230
Wouldn't you agree, Lord Strong?

276
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,670
My Prince, I don't think...

277
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,230
Making a public spectacle
of wanton brutality

278
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,030
is hardly in line with our laws.

279
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:24,709
Nobles from every corner of the realm

280
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,670
are right now descending
upon King's Landing

281
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,070
for my brother's tourney.

282
00:20:28,149 --> 00:20:30,669
Do you want them
mugged, raped, murdered?

283
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:33,470
You mightn't know this unless you
left the safety of the Red Keep

284
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:35,870
but much of King's Landing
is seen by the smallfolk

285
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,630
as lawless and terrifying.

286
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:43,110
Our city should be
safe for all its people.

287
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:44,950
I agree.

288
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,030
I just hope you don't have to maim
half of my city to achieve this.

289
00:20:49,549 --> 00:20:50,870
Time will tell.

290
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:55,270
We installed Prince Daemon as commander

291
00:20:55,349 --> 00:20:57,110
to promote law and order.

292
00:20:57,189 --> 00:20:59,549
The criminal element
should fear the City Watch.

293
00:20:59,629 --> 00:21:01,269
Thank you for your support, Lord Corlys.

294
00:21:01,349 --> 00:21:03,046
If only the Prince would
show the same devotion

295
00:21:03,070 --> 00:21:05,950
to his lady wife as he
does his work, Your Grace.

296
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,590
You've not been seen in the Vale
or at Runestone for quite some time.

297
00:21:09,669 --> 00:21:11,869
I think my bronze bitch
is happier for my absence.

298
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,590
Lady Rhea is your wife.

299
00:21:13,669 --> 00:21:15,630
A good and honorable lady of the Vale.

300
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:18,510
In the Vale, men are said to
fuck sheep instead of women.

301
00:21:18,589 --> 00:21:20,830
I can assure you, the
sheep are prettier.

302
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:21,909
Dear me.

303
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,630
You made a vow before the Seven
to honor your wife in marriage.

304
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:27,190
Well, I'd gladly give Lady
Rhea to you, Lord Hightower

305
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,030
if you're in want of a
woman to warm your bed.

306
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:32,670
Your own lady wife passed recently.

307
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:36,030
Did she not?

308
00:21:36,469 --> 00:21:37,469
Otto.

309
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:42,869
Perhaps you aren't ready
to move on just yet.

310
00:21:43,830 --> 00:21:46,550
You know how my brother
makes sport of provoking you.

311
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,510
Must you indulge him?

312
00:21:52,509 --> 00:21:54,269
My apologies, Your Grace.

313
00:21:54,509 --> 00:21:57,270
This council has, at great expense

314
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:59,990
bettered the City Watch
to your exacting standards.

315
00:22:00,269 --> 00:22:02,750
Enforce my laws, but understand

316
00:22:03,189 --> 00:22:06,869
any further performances like
last night's will be answered.

317
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:12,070
Understood, Your Grace.

318
00:22:25,150 --> 00:22:27,950
King's Landing has been in decline
since my grandmother passed.

319
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:29,989
In the end

320
00:22:30,629 --> 00:22:33,670
this new City Watch
might be a good thing.

321
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,430
What troubles you, my Prince?

322
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,910
I could bring in another.

323
00:23:28,589 --> 00:23:30,189
Perhaps a maiden.

324
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:32,510
I have several.

325
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,910
I could even arrange
one with silver hair.

326
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:45,270
You are Daemon Targaryen.

327
00:23:45,790 --> 00:23:48,870
Rider of Caraxes.
Wielder of Dark Sister.

328
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:51,830
The King cannot replace you.

329
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,669
Be welcome!

330
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:08,910
I know many of you have
traveled long leagues

331
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,630
to be at these games

332
00:24:11,069 --> 00:24:14,310
but I promise, you will
not be disappointed.

333
00:24:15,510 --> 00:24:18,510
When I look at the fine
knights in these lists

334
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:22,150
I see a group without
equal in our histories.

335
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:28,270
And this great day has
been made more auspicious

336
00:24:28,350 --> 00:24:32,150
by the news that I am happy to share.

337
00:24:32,949 --> 00:24:35,869
Queen Aemma has begun her labors!

338
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:42,669
May the luck of the Seven
shine upon all combatants!

339
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,870
A mystery knight?

340
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,110
No, a Cole, of the Storm lands.

341
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,430
I've never heard of House Cole.

342
00:25:19,469 --> 00:25:22,110
Princess Rhaenys Targaryen!

343
00:25:22,189 --> 00:25:26,110
I would humbly ask for the
favor of The Queen Who Never Was.

344
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:33,830
Good fortune to you, cousin.

345
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:36,350
I would gladly take it
if I thought I needed it.

346
00:25:42,389 --> 00:25:45,390
You could have Baratheon's
tongue for that.

347
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,430
Tongues will not change the succession.

348
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,030
Let them wag.

349
00:25:55,309 --> 00:25:56,830
Lord Stokeworth's daughter

350
00:25:56,909 --> 00:25:58,429
is promised to that young Tarly squire.

351
00:25:58,509 --> 00:26:00,149
Lord Massey's son?

352
00:26:00,230 --> 00:26:02,590
They're to be married as soon
as he wins his knighthood.

353
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,310
Best get on with it.

354
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:06,550
I heard that Lady Elinor

355
00:26:06,629 --> 00:26:08,790
is hiding a swollen
belly beneath her dress.

356
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:33,031
What do you know about this
Ser Criston Cole, Ser Harrold?

357
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:36,510
I'm told Ser Criston is common-born,
son of Lord Dondarrion's steward.

358
00:26:36,589 --> 00:26:39,350
But other than that, and the
fact that he's just unhorsed

359
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:42,909
both of the Baratheon
lads, I really couldn't say.

360
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,030
Prince Daemon of House Targaryen!

361
00:27:04,109 --> 00:27:09,270
Prince of the City will now
choose his first opponent!

362
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:50,190
For his first challenge,
Prince Daemon Targaryen chooses

363
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:55,510
Ser Gwayne Hightower of Oldtown,
eldest son of the Hand of the King.

364
00:28:07,710 --> 00:28:10,350
Five dragons on Daemon.

365
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:23,270
- Nicely done, Uncle.
- Thank you, Princess.

366
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:27,870
Now, I'm fairly certain I can
win these games, Lady Alicent.

367
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:31,110
Having your favor
would all but assure it.

368
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:46,270
Good luck, my Prince.

369
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,110
What's happening?

370
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,670
The infant is in breech, Your Grace.

371
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:18,310
All attempts to turn
the babe have failed.

372
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:21,350
Do something for her!

373
00:30:21,429 --> 00:30:23,429
We've given her as much
milk of the poppy as we can

374
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,910
without risking the child.

375
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,590
Your Queen is a strong woman.

376
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:29,950
She's fighting with all her
might, but it may not be enough.

377
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:31,470
No!

378
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:32,910
Aemma.

379
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,110
Aemma, I'm here.

380
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:37,510
I'm here.

381
00:30:38,590 --> 00:30:40,510
I'm here. It's all right.

382
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:42,829
- It's all right.
- I don't wanna do this.

383
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:46,150
You're going to be all right.

384
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:11,470
Kill him!

385
00:31:11,549 --> 00:31:13,910
And the day grows ugly.

386
00:31:17,149 --> 00:31:19,389
I wonder if this is
how we should celebrate

387
00:31:19,469 --> 00:31:21,470
the birth of our future king.

388
00:31:22,069 --> 00:31:23,389
With wanton violence.

389
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:25,670
It's been 70 years
since King Maegor's end.

390
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,430
These knights are as
green as summer grass.

391
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,110
None have known real war.

392
00:31:30,309 --> 00:31:31,886
Their lords sent them
to the tourney field

393
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,670
with fists full of steel
and balls full of seed

394
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:36,950
and we expect them to
act with honor and grace.

395
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:39,990
It's a marvel that war didn't
break out at first blood.

396
00:32:01,870 --> 00:32:02,910
Mellos.

397
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,310
Your Grace.

398
00:32:06,389 --> 00:32:07,629
If you would.

399
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,870
During a difficult birth

400
00:32:18,950 --> 00:32:23,030
it sometimes becomes
necessary for the father

401
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,910
to make an impossible choice.

402
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,750
Well, speak it.

403
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:32,910
To sacrifice one or to lose them both.

404
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:37,310
There is a chance that
we can save the child.

405
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,310
A technique is taught at the Citadel

406
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:41,309
which involves cutting
directly into the womb

407
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:43,110
to free the infant.

408
00:32:43,190 --> 00:32:46,190
- But the resulting blood loss...
- Seven Hells, Mellos.

409
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,950
You can save the child?

410
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:03,990
We must either act now
or leave it with the gods.

411
00:33:15,149 --> 00:33:17,589
Ser Criston Cole will now tilt

412
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:21,830
against Ser Daemon
Targaryen, Prince of the City!

413
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:32,510
- Viserys.
- Yes?

414
00:34:34,430 --> 00:34:36,630
They're going to bring the babe out now.

415
00:34:59,189 --> 00:35:00,429
I love you.

416
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,350
- What is happening?
- No, it's all right.

417
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:13,110
No, what is happening?

418
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:15,446
- Viserys, what...
- No, it's all right.

419
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,446
- What are you doing?
- They're going to bring the babe out.

420
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,630
How are they...

421
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,190
- It's all right.
- Viserys, please...

422
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:22,430
- It's all right.
- No, I'm scared.

423
00:35:22,509 --> 00:35:23,966
- Don't be scared.
- What is happening?

424
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,605
Don't be scared. They're
going to bring the babe out.

425
00:35:25,629 --> 00:35:28,190
- Oh no.
- It's all right.

426
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:29,990
They're going to bring the babe out.

427
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,790
No... no!

428
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,950
I'm making the first incision.

429
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:38,390
No... no!

430
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:41,270
Viserys, no! Please!

431
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:43,670
- No... no!
- Don't be scared.

432
00:36:06,429 --> 00:36:07,830
Sword!

433
00:36:07,910 --> 00:36:09,230
Prince Daemon Targaryen

434
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:12,790
wishes to continue in a contest of arms!

435
00:37:58,350 --> 00:37:59,750
Yield.

436
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:02,230
Yield.

437
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:36,909
Gods. He's Dornish.

438
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,510
I was hoping to ask for
the Princess's favor.

439
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,550
I wish you luck, Ser Criston.

440
00:38:53,629 --> 00:38:55,029
Princess.

441
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:07,870
Congratulations, Your Grace.

442
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,950
You have a son.

443
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:15,190
It's a boy?

444
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:17,550
A new heir, Your Grace.

445
00:39:23,109 --> 00:39:25,509
Had you and the Queen chosen a name?

446
00:39:28,870 --> 00:39:30,110
Baelon.

447
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:46,390
They're waiting for you.

448
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:58,144
_

449
00:40:58,264 --> 00:41:01,850
_

450
00:41:02,324 --> 00:41:04,485
_

451
00:41:04,974 --> 00:41:08,525
_

452
00:41:08,645 --> 00:41:10,866
_

453
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:25,874
Dr...

454
00:41:40,189 --> 00:41:41,389
Dracarys.

455
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:20,630
- Where's Rhaenyra?
- Your Grace.

456
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:23,510
This is the last thing
any of us wish to discuss

457
00:42:23,589 --> 00:42:26,670
at this dark hour, but I
consider the matter urgent.

458
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:27,990
What matter?

459
00:42:29,069 --> 00:42:30,989
That of your succession.

460
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,830
These recent tragedies

461
00:42:32,909 --> 00:42:34,669
have left you without an obvious heir.

462
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:36,270
The King has an heir, my Lord Hand.

463
00:42:36,349 --> 00:42:38,910
Despite how difficult
this time is, Your Grace

464
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,910
I feel it important the
succession be firmly in place

465
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:43,350
for the stability of the realm.

466
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:47,070
The succession is already
set by precedent and by law.

467
00:42:47,149 --> 00:42:48,749
Shall we say his name?

468
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,590
Daemon Targaryen.

469
00:42:52,669 --> 00:42:55,509
If Daemon were to remain
the uncontested heir

470
00:42:55,589 --> 00:42:57,950
it could destabilize the realm.

471
00:42:58,029 --> 00:42:59,909
The realm? Or this council?

472
00:42:59,990 --> 00:43:02,630
No one here can know what
Daemon would do were he king

473
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:05,390
but no one can doubt his ambition.

474
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,870
Look at what he did
with the gold cloaks.

475
00:43:07,950 --> 00:43:09,910
The City Watch is fiercely loyal to him.

476
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:13,590
- An army 2,000 strong.
- An army you gave him, Otto.

477
00:43:13,669 --> 00:43:17,150
I named Daemon Master of Laws,
but you said he was a tyrant.

478
00:43:17,589 --> 00:43:18,589
As Master of Coin

479
00:43:18,669 --> 00:43:21,470
you said he was a spendthrift
that would beggar the realm.

480
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:25,230
Putting Daemon in command of
the City Watch was your solution!

481
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:27,230
A half-measure, Your Grace.

482
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:30,110
The truth is, Daemon should
be far away from this court.

483
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:32,110
Daemon is my brother.

484
00:43:32,190 --> 00:43:33,590
My blood.

485
00:43:34,390 --> 00:43:36,270
And he will have his place at my court.

486
00:43:36,349 --> 00:43:38,470
Let him keep his place
at court, Your Grace

487
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:42,470
but if the gods should visit
some further tragedy on you

488
00:43:42,549 --> 00:43:45,470
- either by design or accident...
- "Design"?

489
00:43:46,029 --> 00:43:47,389
What are you saying?

490
00:43:47,470 --> 00:43:49,870
My brother would murder
me, take my crown?

491
00:43:51,310 --> 00:43:52,550
Are you?

492
00:43:54,070 --> 00:43:55,390
Please.

493
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:59,430
Daemon has ambition, yes,
but not for the throne.

494
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,350
He lacks the patience for it.

495
00:44:01,469 --> 00:44:03,110
The gods have yet to make a man

496
00:44:03,189 --> 00:44:06,509
who lacks the patience for
absolute power, Your Grace.

497
00:44:06,589 --> 00:44:10,310
Under such circumstances,
it would not be an aberration

498
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:12,670
for the King to name a successor.

499
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:14,590
Well, who else would have a claim?

500
00:44:20,990 --> 00:44:22,990
The King's firstborn child.

501
00:44:23,069 --> 00:44:25,469
Rhaenyra? A girl?

502
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,750
No queen has ever sat the Iron Throne.

503
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,846
That is only by tradition
and precedent, Lord Strong.

504
00:44:30,870 --> 00:44:33,030
If order and stability
so concerns this council

505
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,030
then perhaps we shouldn't
break 100 years of it

506
00:44:35,109 --> 00:44:36,789
by naming a girl heir.

507
00:44:36,870 --> 00:44:40,390
Daemon would be a
second Maegor, or worse.

508
00:44:40,509 --> 00:44:43,029
He is impulsive and violent.

509
00:44:43,110 --> 00:44:44,910
It is the duty of this council

510
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,870
to protect the King
and the realm from him.

511
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,630
I'm sorry, Your Grace, but
that is the truth as I see it

512
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,070
and I know that others here agree.

513
00:44:53,149 --> 00:44:56,950
I will not be made to choose
between my brother and my daughter.

514
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,750
You wouldn't have to, Your Grace.

515
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:01,150
There are others who would have a claim.

516
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:02,790
Such as your wife, Lord Corlys?

517
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:05,110
- The Queen Who Never Was?
- Rhaenys was the only child

518
00:45:05,189 --> 00:45:06,309
of Jaehaerys' eldest son.

519
00:45:06,389 --> 00:45:08,310
She had a strong claim
at the Great Council

520
00:45:08,390 --> 00:45:09,645
and she already has a male heir.

521
00:45:09,669 --> 00:45:12,829
Just moments ago, you announced
your support for Daemon!

522
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:14,446
If we cannot agree on an
heir, then how can we expect...

523
00:45:14,470 --> 00:45:16,510
My wife and son are dead!

524
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:20,568
I will not sit here and suffer crows

525
00:45:20,569 --> 00:45:23,190
that come to feast on their corpses!

526
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:57,910
Send a raven to Oldtown. Straight away.

527
00:46:00,910 --> 00:46:02,230
My Lady.

528
00:46:12,190 --> 00:46:13,590
My darling.

529
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,950
How's Rhaenyra?

530
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,190
She lost her mother.

531
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:31,710
The Queen was well-loved by all.

532
00:46:34,029 --> 00:46:36,869
I found myself thinking
of your own mother today.

533
00:46:43,429 --> 00:46:45,750
- How is His Grace?
- Very low.

534
00:46:47,390 --> 00:46:49,070
Which is why I sent for you.

535
00:46:54,230 --> 00:46:58,270
I thought you might go
to him, offer him comfort.

536
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:01,990
In his chambers?

537
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,230
I wouldn't know what to say.

538
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:12,390
Stop that.

539
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:15,750
He'll be glad of a visitor.

540
00:47:23,669 --> 00:47:26,070
You might wear one of
your mother's dresses.

541
00:48:01,110 --> 00:48:03,750
The Lady Alicent Hightower, Your Grace.

542
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:11,150
What is it, Alicent?

543
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:13,430
I thought I might come and
look in on you, Your Grace.

544
00:48:15,189 --> 00:48:16,509
I brought a book.

545
00:48:18,870 --> 00:48:20,710
That's very kind, thank you.

546
00:48:25,549 --> 00:48:26,910
It's a favorite of mine.

547
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:30,030
I do know how passionate
you are for the histories.

548
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:33,470
Yes, I am.

549
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:51,670
When my mother died

550
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:55,590
people only ever spoke to me in riddles.

551
00:48:57,389 --> 00:48:59,406
All I wanted was for someone
to say that they were sorry

552
00:48:59,430 --> 00:49:01,070
for what happened to me.

553
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,750
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

554
00:49:52,830 --> 00:49:53,830
Thank you.

555
00:49:55,750 --> 00:49:58,070
The King's sole heir once again.

556
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:02,870
Might we drink to our future?

557
00:50:04,069 --> 00:50:05,509
Quiet!

558
00:50:05,589 --> 00:50:08,510
Your Prince will speak!

559
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:13,550
Silence!

560
00:50:18,669 --> 00:50:20,670
Before we begin, Your Grace

561
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:24,910
I have a report I feel
compelled to share.

562
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:27,750
Last night

563
00:50:28,589 --> 00:50:31,229
Prince Daemon bought out
one of the pleasure houses

564
00:50:31,309 --> 00:50:32,950
on the Street of Silk

565
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:36,830
to entertain officers of the City Watch

566
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:38,710
and other friends of his.

567
00:50:41,990 --> 00:50:44,150
King and Council have
long rued my position

568
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:46,390
as next in line for the throne.

569
00:50:47,509 --> 00:50:50,036
But dream and pray as they all might,

570
00:50:50,037 --> 00:50:52,950
it seems I'm not so easily replaced.

571
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:57,670
The gods give just
as the gods take away.

572
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,630
He toasted Prince Baelon.

573
00:50:59,710 --> 00:51:01,190
To the King's son.

574
00:51:01,790 --> 00:51:03,550
Styling him...

575
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:06,910
the Heir for a Day.

576
00:51:13,429 --> 00:51:17,350
I corroborated this report
with three separate witnesses.

577
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:21,630
The evening was, by all
accounts, a celebration.

578
00:51:23,390 --> 00:51:26,390
You cut the image of
the conqueror, brother.

579
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:28,909
Did you say it?

580
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:32,550
I don't know what you mean.

581
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,070
You will address me as "Your Grace"

582
00:51:34,149 --> 00:51:37,069
or I will have my Kingsguard 
cut out your tongue.

583
00:51:40,509 --> 00:51:44,950
"The Heir for a Day." Did you say it?

584
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:56,790
We must all mourn in
our own way, Your Grace.

585
00:51:58,069 --> 00:52:01,269
My family has just been destroyed.

586
00:52:02,350 --> 00:52:05,230
But instead of being by
my side, or Rhaenyra's

587
00:52:05,310 --> 00:52:07,990
you chose to celebrate your own rise!

588
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:11,150
Laughing with your whores
and your lickspittles!

589
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:16,190
You have no allies at court but me!

590
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:18,870
I have only ever defended you!

591
00:52:18,950 --> 00:52:21,350
Yet everything I've given you,
you've thrown back in my face.

592
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,309
You've only ever tried to send me away.

593
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:27,790
To the Vale, to the City Watch,
anywhere but by your side.

594
00:52:27,870 --> 00:52:29,790
Ten years you've been king

595
00:52:29,870 --> 00:52:32,870
and yet not once have you
asked me to be your Hand!

596
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:35,909
- Why would I do that?
- Because I'm your brother.

597
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,750
And the blood of the dragon runs thick.

598
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:40,910
Then why do you cut me so deeply?

599
00:52:40,990 --> 00:52:44,750
I've only ever spoken the truth. I
see Otto Hightower for what he is.

600
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:47,670
- An unwavering and loyal Hand?
- A cunt.

601
00:52:48,669 --> 00:52:50,670
A second son who stands
to inherit nothing

602
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,990
he doesn't seize for himself.

603
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:54,229
Otto Hightower is a more honorable man

604
00:52:54,309 --> 00:52:56,309
- than you could ever be.
- He doesn't protect you.

605
00:52:56,350 --> 00:52:58,110
- I would.
- From what?

606
00:52:58,189 --> 00:52:59,589
Yourself.

607
00:53:02,909 --> 00:53:05,469
You're weak, Viserys.

608
00:53:08,110 --> 00:53:09,566
And that council of leeches knows it.

609
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,870
They all prey on you for their own ends.

610
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:18,430
I have decided to name a new heir.

611
00:53:18,509 --> 00:53:21,030
- I'm your heir.
- Not anymore.

612
00:53:22,149 --> 00:53:25,589
You are to return to Runestone
and your lady wife at once

613
00:53:25,669 --> 00:53:30,670
and you are to do so without
quarrel by order of your King.

614
00:53:45,070 --> 00:53:46,710
Your Grace.

615
00:54:43,469 --> 00:54:44,670
Father.

616
00:54:48,669 --> 00:54:50,430
Balerion was the last living creature

617
00:54:50,510 --> 00:54:53,030
to have seen Old
Valyria before the Doom.

618
00:54:55,629 --> 00:54:57,590
Its greatness and its flaws.

619
00:54:58,109 --> 00:55:00,309
When you look at the
dragons, what do you see?

620
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:01,910
What?

621
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:04,750
You haven't spoken a word
to me since Mother's funeral

622
00:55:04,830 --> 00:55:06,325
and now you send your
Kingsguard down...

623
00:55:06,349 --> 00:55:07,870
Answer me.

624
00:55:10,189 --> 00:55:11,589
It's important.

625
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:13,510
What do you see?

626
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:23,630
- I suppose I see us.
- Tell me.

627
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:28,270
Everyone says Targaryens are
closer to gods than to men

628
00:55:28,350 --> 00:55:30,950
but they say that
because of our dragons.

629
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:34,790
Without them, we're
just like everyone else.

630
00:55:37,309 --> 00:55:42,470
The idea that we control
the dragons is an illusion.

631
00:55:44,430 --> 00:55:47,270
They're a power man should
never have trifled with.

632
00:55:48,669 --> 00:55:50,750
One that brought Valyria its doom.

633
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:54,269
If we don't mind our own histories,
it will do the same to us.

634
00:55:55,030 --> 00:55:57,590
Targaryen must understand
this to be King...

635
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:00,030
or Queen.

636
00:56:04,109 --> 00:56:05,869
I'm sorry, Rhaenyra.

637
00:56:06,629 --> 00:56:09,430
I have wasted the years
since you were born

638
00:56:09,510 --> 00:56:11,110
wanting for a son.

639
00:56:22,589 --> 00:56:24,509
You are the very best of your mother.

640
00:56:27,470 --> 00:56:29,710
And I believe it, I know she did

641
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:32,150
that you could be a great ruling queen.

642
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:33,790
Daemon is your heir.

643
00:56:35,149 --> 00:56:37,669
Daemon was not made to wear the crown.

644
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:39,750
But I believe that you were.

645
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,590
Corlys of House Velaryon

646
00:56:43,669 --> 00:56:47,630
Lord of the Tides and
Master of Driftmark.

647
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:50,790
I, Corlys Velaryon

648
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:53,830
Lord of the Tides and
Master of Driftmark

649
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:55,830
promise to be faithful to King Viserys

650
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:58,790
and his named heir,
the Princess Rhaenyra.

651
00:56:58,870 --> 00:57:00,830
I pledge fealty to them

652
00:57:00,910 --> 00:57:03,030
and shall defend them
against all enemies

653
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:05,430
in good faith and without deceit.

654
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:12,710
I swear this by the
old gods and the new.

655
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:17,750
This is no trivial gesture, Rhaenyra.

656
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:19,830
A dragon's saddle is one thing

657
00:57:19,910 --> 00:57:22,950
but the Iron Throne is the most
dangerous seat in the realm.

658
00:57:23,790 --> 00:57:25,670
I, Lord Hobert Hightower

659
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,990
Beacon of the South,
Defender of the Citadel

660
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:29,509
and Voice of Oldtown

661
00:57:29,589 --> 00:57:32,190
promise to be faithful to King Viserys

662
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:35,270
and his named heir,
the Princess Rhaenyra.

663
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:39,470
I pledge fealty to them

664
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:41,430
and shall defend them
against all enemies

665
00:57:41,509 --> 00:57:44,110
in good faith and without deceit.

666
00:57:44,870 --> 00:57:47,670
I swear this by the
old gods and the new.

667
00:57:54,389 --> 00:57:55,790
Give me your hand.

668
00:58:09,750 --> 00:58:11,710
I, Boremund Baratheon

669
00:58:12,669 --> 00:58:16,070
promise to be faithful to King Viserys.

670
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:21,350
There's something else
that I need to tell you.

671
00:58:21,429 --> 00:58:23,389
It might be difficult
for you to understand

672
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,190
but you must hear it.

673
00:58:26,030 --> 00:58:27,510
Our histories

674
00:58:27,590 --> 00:58:30,510
they tell us that Aegon looked across
the Blackwater from Dragonstone

675
00:58:30,589 --> 00:58:33,070
saw a rich land ripe for the capture.

676
00:58:34,350 --> 00:58:37,350
But ambition alone is not
what drove him to conquest.

677
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:39,630
It was a dream.

678
00:58:40,189 --> 00:58:42,349
And just as Daenys
foresaw the end of Valyria

679
00:58:42,429 --> 00:58:45,110
Aegon foresaw the end
of the world of men.

680
00:58:45,990 --> 00:58:50,670
'Tis to begin with a terrible winter
gusting out of the distant north.

681
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:53,950
I, Rickon Stark, Lord of Winterfell...

682
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,310
Aegon saw absolute darkness
riding on those winds.

683
00:58:57,389 --> 00:59:00,989
And whatever dwells within will
destroy the world of the living.

684
00:59:01,429 --> 00:59:04,550
When this Great Winter comes, Rhaenyra

685
00:59:04,629 --> 00:59:07,069
all of Westeros must stand against it.

686
00:59:07,349 --> 00:59:08,686
And if the world of men is to survive

687
00:59:08,710 --> 00:59:11,270
a Targaryen must be
seated on the Iron Throne.

688
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,229
A king or queen

689
00:59:13,309 --> 00:59:16,950
strong enough to unite the realm
against the cold and the dark.

690
00:59:19,269 --> 00:59:22,110
Aegon called his dream
"The Song of Ice and Fire."

691
00:59:24,790 --> 00:59:25,910
This secret...

692
00:59:26,909 --> 00:59:29,629
it's been passed from king
to heir since Aegon's time.

693
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:33,430
Now you must promise to carry it

694
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:35,509
and protect it.

695
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:39,990
Promise me this, Rhaenyra.

696
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:45,630
Promise me.

697
00:59:51,189 --> 00:59:56,390
I, Viserys Targaryen, first of his name

698
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:01,470
King of the Andals, and the
Rhoynar, and the First Men

699
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:06,230
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,
and Protector of the Realm

700
01:00:07,190 --> 01:00:08,630
do hereby name

701
01:00:09,389 --> 01:00:11,349
Rhaenyra Targaryen

702
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:13,630
Princess of Dragonstone

703
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,150
and heir to the Iron Throne.

704
01:00:34,645 --> 01:00:44,753
