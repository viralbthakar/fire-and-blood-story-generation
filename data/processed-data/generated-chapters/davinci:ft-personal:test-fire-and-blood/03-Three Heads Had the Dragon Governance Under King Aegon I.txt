Aegon I Targaryen was one of the greatest Targaryens to ever reign. With his fire and steel, he forged a renown for himself that extended far beyond Westeros and into the most distant corners of the world. His loyal subjects could see him in their dreams; his enemies trembled at the sound of his name in terror. To commemorate this, Aegon constructed the Iron Throne with a thousand swords cooled by dragonfire - a significant symbol recognized as one of his greatest accomplishments during his rule.
Aegon I Targaryen made great efforts to promote the reconciliation of the Seven Kingdoms to Targaryen rule, which were encouraged by his loyal subjects across Westeros. Those who witnessed Aegon's cunning and courage first-hand served him ururedly as he forged a realm greater than any other before or since. Even as former enemies like House Lannister's eldest son, Loren Lannister's heir Loren, bowed down in reverence, nobles likeEvenstarof Tarth King Jaehaerys Alton Celtigar and Archmaester Lyonce shared their tales of Aegon's fire and steel with those who had not yet flourished under his reign of renown. Tall septons referred to him as "the greatest" while even distant corners of the former seven kingdoms witnesssed how significant an impact targarian rule had on them - terrorized yet utterly transfixed by their new ruler - and urged loyalty onto Aegon I all over again.
Visenya and her queenly sisters took a special delight in arranging matches-marriage between noble houses. Aegon had recently sealed a reconciliation of the Seven Kingdoms to Targaryen rule, ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity, so were encouraged by their father in the many betrothals that were arranged. A double wedding was arranged between House Blackwood and Bracken with a Redwyne girl matched with Loren Lannister's eldest son. The Evenstar of Tarth, Ronnel Arryn, Torrhen Stark's daughter Rowan girl even found herself with child by a scullion on one such forged connection far across the Seven Kingdoms. Lords like Corbray, Hightower Harlaw and great septons from all corners of the realm witnessed these reconciliations as they sought to end former centuries old enmity of rivals while young Aegon Targaryen III was yet an infant fostered at Winterfell with his heir older brothers; princes Aenys and Jaehaerys I.
Aegon Targaryen, Visenya and Rhaenys were determined to bring unity and solidarity to the Seven Kingdoms as they traveled from far ends of the realm, visiting places like Dragonstone and King's Landing. They brokered a number of matches between noble houses in order to strengthen their rule. Good Queen Alysanne, alongside King Jaehaerys I had doubted Aegon’s abilities when he first began ruling, though over time his power was exercised successfully across much of the Seven Kingdoms - sealing many peace treaties with kingdoms old enemies. In particular, he arranged double weddings between House Blackwood and Bracken making a match that would go on for centuries while also fostering an illegitimate child of one Redwyne girl and another Rowan girl. This final act unified not just warring houses but custom towards illegitimacy within the seven kingdoms one by one.
Aegon's designated seat of power, Aegonfort at King's Landing, was quickly becoming established as he installed smoky red bricks and ten times more comfortable furnishings. As he spent the necessary funds to make sure that the castle was safe and historical enough for a royal family, its salt-and-smokey brimstone aroma wafted between every corner announcing his presence there. It gave him a feeling of love and comfort knowing that his children now had a much safer place to live than Dragonstone would provide them. Naturally, by the final hours of ruling from both Dragonmont and Old Oak before traveling to King’s Landing, much time and custom had already been exercised in an attempt to restore peace throughout the Seven Kingdoms.
Aegon, devoted to taking his court from one castle to another in an endless royal progress, moved from King's Landing and Aegonfort to Gulltown, The Eyrie, Harrenhal and Riverrun. He visited the great western strongholds of Lannisport and Casterly Rock before arriving at Crakehall and Old Oak. Upon reaching Highgarden which had ten times more comfortable accommodation than the smoky Dragonstone where he had once spent his childhood - Aegon found himself even more devoted to its wonders! Here, he was safe under historical walls dining on salt fish and smokey bacon while His lords embraced him with love like a true king. Aegon felt he so belonged here as successive months were spent visiting different castles every month that took him to far ends of realm such as Evenfall Hall at Pyke or Great Wyk among many other places invited by some noble or the other; showing off both their power but also kindness through an everlasting hospitality that kept Aegon staying for weeks on end before moving on to the next castle or home.
Aegon and his court continued to forestall rebellions across the Seven Kingdoms by mounted tours of endless royal progress, taking his court from one castle to another and guesting with each of his great lords in turn. His glittering procession was attended by knights clothed in fine silk and steel and the smallfolk instilled him with a power that he needed. Some nights they encamped in Lord Edmyn Tully's Far Oak, some nights at Viserys Targaryen's old Dragonmont or on Addison Hill atop Harrenhal - but Aegon never stayed anywhere long enough to tire of it.
Aegon and Aenys accompanied by knights, glittering in silk and steel put their plan into action; the royal progress was a means to regain control and power of the kingdom. From castle to farmer's field, they traveled, feasting and hunting along the way. In each lord's court where they stopped on their journey, Aegon and Aenys sought to instill order while offering great splendor and hospitality as reward for loyalty. They made note of all they had learned from the smallfolk during their travels in hopes it would prove needed when confronting rebellions that might forestall them from reaching an ultimate goal - unifying all seven kingdoms one.
King Aegon had conquered all seven kingdoms, but he allowed the existing laws and customs to remain in place, confirming and retaining that which the Seven Kingdoms already possessed. His royal progress was a testament to his great splendor; feasts, balls and hunts, hawking-- these were all held at every corner of his realm; both small castles and vast holdfasts were endowed with great hospitality as they traveled and held court. Everywhere Aegon went on this grand tour, he made note of what he learned at each stop: how things were done across Westeros-- from Highgarden in the Reach to Dragonstone near Dorne-- allowing them to continue their own traditions without interference.
King Aegon had conquered Westeros during his Conquest, but it was expected that he would adjudicate and decree who will hold what lands from the great to the petty. And so it goes that Aegon settled on making his eldest son Loren Lannister's heir of Casterly Rock and suppporting him as chief among common lords in the seven kingdoms one, while confirming the existing great lords to remain in place and retain their power over small lords. This way, stability throughout the realm was maintained and fighting avoided amongst old enemies. Meanwhile, countries around Westeros recognized this decision as fact with Evenstar of Tarth, King Jaehaerys even allowing House Blackwood and house Harlaw to remain separate yet equal partners in rule with every corner of the realm adjudicated well by Aegon's wise hand.
King Aegon was determined to regularizing his kingship in the Seven Kingdoms and so he proclaimed the exact precise manner in which justice was to be affirmed by the court, claiming that it would be holy, godly even. In his doing so he settled a dispute among Aegonfort, Highgarden and Maidenpool to which many houses had expected him to adjudicate or decree - a common occurrence as every petty lord across Westeros looks to their King as their chief authority figure.Lord Edmyn Tully had presented himself at court with his long held grievance of House Harlaw over an old wrong; a crime that likely goes back past Aenys Targaryen who conquered this land in earlier days. Fortunately for Lord Tully, King Aegon decided on behalf of House Harlaw and goes down as another example of how assertive yet fair Aegon The Conqueror truly is -- garnering admiration from evens the most great of houses throughout all corners of Westeros.
King Aegon had proclaimed regularizing his reign throughout the court and affirmed himself as holy and godly. When he grew older, along with his sister-wives Visenya and Rhaenys, the Three of them began their Conquest forming King's Landing at what is now known to be Aegon's High Hill. While Visenya threw up her own castle on an hill that later came to be known as Visenya's Hill, Rhaenys too builded a great fortress upon adjacent hill - Hill of Rhaenys. The newly constructed city soon appeared among the crude motte-and-bailey fort thrown up fifty feet high by Aegon near the mouth of Blackwater Rush together with its great hills near it; under which dwelled in its cavernous longhall roofed with slate in case of fire. Amongst this regal setting emerged Loren Lannister’s eldest son, fulfilling his destiny as heir to Evenstar of Tarth thus completing Jaehaarlys’s task undertaken in Conclave far beyond Winterfell years ago.
In the fifty years since Aegon, Visenya and Rhaenys conquered King’s Landing, a flourishing ty-town had sprung up around it. Oldtown and the Free Cities sent immigrants to open shops in Maidenpool and Duskendale; merchants gathered between Visenya's Hill and the Hill of Rhaenys; a fish market sprang up along the riverside, a cloth market between the hills. A customs house was built on Visenya's Hill near Aegonfort, where wealthy families from around Westeros now lived in comfort while all around them squalid tents were erected as poor immigrants crowded into King's Landing looking for work. The city walls were raised higher too, enclosing all these new people within, then Lord Alton Celtigar all but closed off Blackwater Rush with a wall of his own--but none could stop its prosperity: soon buildings burst out of its walls creating great hills near mouth Blackwater Rush many times more grand than that once crude motte-and-bailey fort fifty feet high with nothing but a cavernous longhall beneath it roofed with slate in case of fire.
Aegon's coronation as the King of the Seven Kingdoms was planned meticulously to bring prosperity and peace. He had grown outgrown his father's rule, and now he strove to make King's Landing a thriving hub of culture and life. In order to do so, Aenys' Targaryen and Leo Lannister's eldest son joined forces in building fortifications all around Gulltown and White Harbor, while they raised walls in Oldtown which would soon be an inviting gathering place for both the wealthy and poor alike. In this way, Aegon turned what was once fragmented cities into true powerhouses that were able to weather any storms - both metaphorical ones from within the kingdoms, or literal ones like those thrown at them by Dornish cutthroats from beyond Westeros' far reaches.
Aegon, together with his sister Rhaenys and dragon Meraxes, planned a raid in the Summer Isles, reaching as far as the Tall Trees Town. He gave orders to sack and plunder the town, thus carrying off much of its wealth to Westeros. He also ordered the construction of a ring of walls around King’s Landing that were defended by a massive gatehouse and defensive towers. The mouth of Blackwater Bay had grown so full and outgrown Gulltown and White Harbor that it was now a thriving port in its own right. Aegon I had become a true conqueror after this successful campaign - something even his father Jaehaerys would say boasted great glory.
Ser Osmund, Lord Orys Baratheon and Lord Edmyn Tully returned from the Dornish War triumphant but with a profound loss as Ser Osmund lost his sword hand. Alton Celtigar, King Jaehaerys' bastard half-brother was named as the fourth Hand of the King's after it was decided that the Kings Hand should have a hand - first by natural causes then again due to Ser Osmund's injury. To defend their success in battle Grande Maester Lyonce joined Loren Lannister’s eldest son and Aegon Targaryen, Evenstar of Tarth at Maidenpool to discuss building a ring of walls around Westeros. The trio soon sallied forth talking along Tall Trees Town’s side roads discussing how they would carry out such an enormous feat. But neither were prepared for what awaited them when ventured into Oldtown - raids had plundered supplies leaving the once strong city vulnerable and fragile in its wake. Yet, with the help of House Blackwood and smallfolk near Gulltown they were able to construct defensive towers which guarded King's Landing grandly.
Grand Maester Gawen had been at Dragonstone since the days of Aegon Targaryen's Conquest, having come from Oldtown to serve as a trusted advisor. Through him and seven generations of maesters that followed, Aegon and his heirs learned how to keep culture alive through written records, inspired works of literature, reliance upon magic and the rare breed of dragons kept under their control. From Grand Maester Gawen onward great knowledge was maintained by the realm's elite on matters ranging from understanding politics abroad to training horses for jousting tournaments--even in far ends of the realm like Iron Throne or Hill of Rhaenys.  It seemed no matter what corner Aegon looked too he could always rely upon the faithfulness of his maesters even in trying times such as those brought about by Dornish War with Lord Orys Baratheon's return marked with pronounced loss of his sword hand. Though tidings were dealt thankfully relieved it was decreed that The King Hand should have a hand still capable enough to draw a blade in defense; thus King Jaehaerys named his bastard half-brother Ser Osmund fourth The King Hand following old Lord Edmyn Tully and Alton Celtigar before him.
Aegon and the Conclave of Archmaesters, whom Grand Maester Gawen had asked to create a great council of the wisest and most learned minds in Westeros, were gathered together at the Citadel in Oldtown. The Seven Kingdoms waited with anticipation for what this ancient seat of learning would decree, as lords both great and lesser looked to them for guidance and relied upon their words on matters both within the land and beyond its borders.  Aegon had journeyed from Dragonstone where he had conquered seven kingdoms one by one, accompanied by his sister-queens Rhaenys and Visenya as they bred, trained and carried dragons far into every corner of the realm. He trusted that here at Oldtown, now amongst these "masters of coin", a powerful new force could coalesce that would write history anew.
Archmaester Lyonce's idea of the Conclave seemed even more absurd when Grand Maester Gawen slipped in the mud trying to serve as their elected leader. Aegon had been asked to create the wisest and most learned group of men, yet three of those selected were elevated exceptationally quickly - Archmaester Ollidar, a tall septon; Alton Celtigar, an old hedge knight bastard born; and Richard Roote from House Harlaw. All three proved to be both wise and robust beyond expectation, helping lay the foundations for what would become some of the strongest rulers in seven kingdoms history - King Jaehaerys, Queen Alysanne, King Robert and all Sixteen Targaryens that followed.
King Jaehaerys the Conciliator had consulted Grand Maesters, masters of coin, High Septon of Oldtown and even sought advice from his two Queens Rhaenys and Visenya before he institutioned his small council in King's Landing. The Starry Sept was visited in full bloom every year by the Kings Hand while Aegon I Targaryen made tour of Dragonsone and Oldtown to discuss the matters with advisers. Evenstar of Tarth attended some meetings as a guest along with her brothers and tall septons. The concilors carefully selected Lord Orys Baratheon for council after observing his robust knowledge about war (refers to previous_paragraph). It was said that Queen Visenyas speeches could make even Lord Monkeyface shed tears - truly an exceptionaly old phenomenon! Gregor Goode and Dornish cutthroat joined ranks one after another as sworn swords of House Blackwood at same instance making them eligible for Council’s selection to serve Kingdom’s needs.
Queen Rhaenys, Queen Visenya and King Aegon left the crumbling ruins of Dragonmont in the Seven Kingdoms to begin their Conquest. Showering cries of delight from their followers, they rode through Dornish Marches, Oldtown and even as far North as The Wall with a spirit like no other. Composed songs were sang by bards as they reminded everyone that "the gods had become one" after a year full of frivolous battles such as the War at Maidenpool and Gulltown. This was indeed glorious! As Richard Roote, an old hedge knight said - "This young Targaryen king will be remembered forever!", while Evenstar of Tarth shouted," Long live King Aegon!".
Queen Rhaenys wasted no time in holding court, wherever the Seven Kingdoms (save in Dorne) lay; from Aegonfort to Tall Trees Town. The smallfolk saw only kindness and special love from her, and every lawful right was given out, so it is not surprising that she soon gained renown all across Westeros. On one such visit to a farmer's field on the Dornish Marches came an incident where Queen Rhaenys had to chastise a man and woman who quarrelled with her brothers claiming they had wronged them. After striking both of them one by one with her showel, Queen Rhaenys sternly produced parchments detailing their rights - something she became renowned for. Despite the gravity of this situation, empathy shone on the two offenders inspiring what could be seen as frivolous adoration for the glorious queen.
Queen Rhaenys and her brothers, Aenys and Torrhen Stark, carefully consulted the maesters and septons when holding court on the Hill of Rhaenys. They took counsel from both men of faith and men of letters regarding how to render judgement, and how to chastise those who had transgressed lawful rights. Queen Rhaenys was particularly strict with any who were adulterous or unfaithful - swift justice was taken as soon as it was given by Queen Rhaenys upon all those disobedient to law. She also held a special love for her smallfolk, whose rights she sought to uphold no matter what corner of the Seven Kingdoms (save in Dorne) they resided in.
Queen Visenya Targaryen had a fittingly tempestuous relationship with her brother, Lord Monkeyface. They would often share love and jolly hours at Viseyna's Hill, the place where Visenya kept her own fool, choked to death on a peach pit, and famously acquired an ape she dressed in silk and amused herself immensely with it's hirsute hunchbacked cleverness. Queen Visenya was known throughout Westeros as one of the 16 Targaryens that also included Lake Lannister's eldest son, Evenstar of Tarth, King Jaehaerys and Gregor Goode that intitled her to share in Aegon I's power across all seven Kingdoms (save Dorne). In stark contrast to her sister Rhaenys who consulted Maesters and septons from The Highgarden Maidenpool Iron Throne Dragonstone Crakehall Winterfell Hill of Rhaenys until everybody including the Kingsguard House Blackwood  was taken aback by her rending judgement for adulterous faithless obedient or lawful deeds; when it came to ruling Queens Rhaenys raised all low while Viseny my gave Thrones away.
Queen Visenya had always been known for her strength and fierce will, which was evident to all when Lord Monkeyface once said that she kept her own fool better than any other royal. Her reputation only grew after the surprising news of his terrible death; he had choked to death on a peach pit, quite unbecoming for someone as proud of themselves as him. Some attributed it to divine justice for having acquired an ape without consulting the Gods. Despite come speculation, there were few who truly understood what made Visenya Targaryen so feared and respected by many in the Seven Kingdoms - her adeptness at wielding Divine magic. She had delved deep into its dark corners, much like she did with mixing ordinary with magical ingredients while casting spells; a grim yet unforgiving beauty that revealed why so many feared and admired Queen Visenya's stern gaze throughout Westeros.
Visenya Targaryen, who had wielded her mix of beauty and stern delicacy like a weapon throughout the Dornish war, urgently urged her brother Aegon to protect the king as they encountered a cruel, suspicious and ferocious Dornish cutthroat. While he refused at first; Visenya's uncompromising strength told him that she would not be swayed so easily. She rushed forward, sword drawn, slashing out with all the ferocity of a true Targaryen. Evenstar knew their cause was too important for anything less - she would see it through until either King Jaehaerys or her brothers were victorious in this unforgiving conflict.
Aegon and Visenya had seen the horrors of Dornish War, and so when King Jaehaerys urged for the formation of a unit to protect the realm Aegon had no hesitation in surrendering his own life to be served. Eight knights chosen from all corners of Westeros stood tall in purest white robes, sworn to live lives of chastity, obedience and honor. Defending the king and six Seven Kingdoms was their singular cause, an event that would shape history forever as they had refused surrendering even when faced with his ferocity a cruel suspicious.
When King Aegon and Visenya came forward at the tourney of knights, they were confident that a great champion would emerge to be worthy enough to join their Kingsguard. Holding a blade in each hand as required by tradition, those who stepped onto the battlefield knew not only did they risk their lives, but also had to choose honor over dishonor if they wished to live. Their determination was exemplified by the purest white cloaks of chastity and obedience that every knight proudly wore while they served in this noble order. But what took them all aback was how skillful these men turned out to be; Never before had there been such an intense melee between warriors from all ends of the Seven Kingdoms and from even farther beyond its borders.
After the tourney and melee were finished, King Aegon selected a few brave individuals from every corner of the realm to give up their royal titles and serve him as his chosen group of bodyguards. The group included young lords, old knights, tall septons, short maesters, dark Starry Sept students as well as fair-skinned bastards born of powerful hedge knights. Those chosen had all demonstrated their quick reflexes, strength and skill in battle or exhibited an exceptional level of observation skills and loyalty worthy for the great risk they needed to take in order to be part of this service. His oldest son Loren Lannister's eldest looked on proudly whilst Evenstar of Tarth surveyed this scene that would shape Westeros forever.
Donning his brave and honorable armor, Aegon and eight other chosen leaders from every corner of the realm - Richard Roote, Addison Hill, Gregor Goode, Griffith Goode, Humfrey the Mummer, Robin Darklyn, Corlys Velaryon and Visenya Targaryen – set out to serve with valor in what would be known as the Dornish War. Despite giving up their lives and families for this mission, they remained quick-witted, strong-spirited and keenly observant. The nine turned out to be highly skilled warriors who performed admirably throughout the war.
The intrepid Aegon the Dragon, Robert, and Sixteen Targaryens followed their destiny in toppling the Mad King and claiming the Iron Throne. Yet such a feat of bravery was considered to be both wise and foolish; cruel yet kind; good yet evil. How well it would all turn out remained a mystery, but many in Westeros believed that this brave group had followed an honorable path that ultimately belonged to them.
