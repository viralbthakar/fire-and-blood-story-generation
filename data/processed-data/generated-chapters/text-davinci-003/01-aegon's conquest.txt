Aegon had finally arrived in Westeros with his Targaryen host, and set out to accomplish the impossible: the Conquest of all Seven Kingdoms. As he campaigned from castle to keep, from rivermouths to Storm’s End, news of his destruction preceded him. His victories over Harren the Black and Loren of House Lannister were legendary tales that spread far and wide among the people of Westeros. Before long he reached the Citadel, a feat even Daenys the Dreamer could not have foreseen when she predicted her brother would be invinsible on conquest. Aegon I Targaryen was now King in all but name, but there was still a date yet to keep before his destiny as Conqueror could be realized.
Aegon, now the rightful ruler of Westeros, had to take his Conquest beyond just the walls of The Citadel. He embarked upon a journey that would see him land in Seven Kingdoms and be coronated at Oldtown. During this time different Wars of Conquest took place all over the kingdom in an effort to bring it under one banner. Aegon's plan worked, with much success; however, it remained incomplete until he could bring in the Dornishmen to support his cause. To truly fix his vision and make sure that what he started with was true and precise, Aegon decided to know every corner of his new world before moving forward.
Aegon I Targaryen had successfully landed on the Blackwater Rush and, in doing so, had forged connections that would date back to his coronation at Oldtown thereafter. Having been anointed with the Starry Sept by his loyal lords of House Targaryen hosting him at Aegon's Landing, he set forth on the great Wars of Conquest throughout Westeros which would ultimately bring in forces from Dorne and the Iron Islands to fix what remained incomplete in the Seven Kingdoms.  With Harren the Black and Loren of House Lannister supporting Aegon, or Lady Marla Sunderland who married Aerys - all representing different sides of their true allegiances-the precise balance was finally achieved as tension dissolved over time between The Reach, Stormlands and Dorne...
Aenar Targaryen, the last of the exiled Targaryens from Valyria, had moved his family to Dragonstone following their view of the Doom of Valyria. In an attempt to rebuild his dynasty and find a new home for himself and those who remained with him, he sold some of their ancient land in Lands of the Long Summer to the Hooks and Mudds hoping to better himself in Freehold. This was no easy task in such a bleak place plagued by pirates and rulers like Harren the Black before him. Aenar's daughter Daenys predicted that one day her father's family would regain power - perhaps enough to stand against even Lords Fell and Buckler or Loran Lannister I . But how could they succeed?
Lord Aenar's maiden daughter Daenys and the surviving Targaryens had vied for refuge after The Doom of Valyria shattered their ancient home. Lord Aenar, his daughters, sons and scores of Noble Houses loyal to him fled together, often times pursued by pirates as they sought a new home in Dragonstone. While some cowered in fear at the fate foreseen by Daenys -The Dreamer-s many were determined to survive and find the greatest shining city beyond the endless waters in which they sailed so quickly from Valryia. This gambit took strength, strategy and oft savage cunning - a subtlety that could easily be mistaken for cowardice. Queen Rhaenys Targaryen gathered her people under her wings at Dragonstone, hoping that this would provide not only refuge but also perhaps a new beginning for House Targaryen as well as other families who had shared in their refugee from Valryia.
The house of Targaryen, Velaryon, and Celtigar had fled Valyria in the aftermath of The Doom and found refuge at Dragonstone. It was here they held a stranglehold over Blackwater Bay and the Gullet, filling their ships with goods from all points along the Narrow Sea. For two centuries they dominated Driftmark, Claw Isle, along with other small outposts dotted off in the westernmost region. But now their shining legacy was threatened by both cowardice and those who vied for power beyond Valyria’s reach—not to mention those that foreseen its demise yet survived nonetheless as one of its greatest legacies.
The Doom of Valyria had passed, and two centuries later, a new dynasty arose from their ashes. Known as the Targaryens, Gaemon followed in the footsteps of his ancestors Aenar the Exile and Daenys the Dreamer to lead them forward. They ruled for many years until it was time for Aegon to pass gloryously down to Elaena, Maegon, Aerys and finally Aelyx who were all born from Aegon's only sister Visenya Targaryen. In that time they held a stranglehold on Westeros at Dragonstone and soon their influence spread far out into the Narrow Sea islands like Blackwater Bay and Gullet. To ensure supremacy in those areas, Baelon and Daemion under Lord Aenar's commission set up outpost on each island thus establishing a dominating presence over more than one hundred kingdoms across the westmost part of The Seven Kingdoms known as The Vale of Arryn which they had filled with allies such as Velaryons, Celtigars, Clansmen Fishers and Mudds whom have held true keeping two centuries old peace between Stormlanders Cassells Masseys Stonedance Darklyns Lords Fell Pipers Oakhearts Strong Durrandons Hooks Baratheons Brackens Whent Mallisters Redwynes Harroways Kestrel Vances DeBarras Crakehalls Blunts Lynderlys Hightower Morrigens Jordaynes Thorns Mertyns Bucklers Blackwoods Erenfords Reynes Lothstons Reyne Flints Smallwoods Ashwoods Crowleys Rogers Cafferen Tyrell Tarbecks Trouts Shermer Homsey Toynet Wyldiards Justmans Roone Follard Allyrions Flowers Sharps Hollards Rowans Yews Penrose Conningtons Allyrs Garths Grandison Coverts Sarsfields Serrys Stackhouses Webbers Varner Preyers Corbrays Waxley Hoares Moonhill}.
Aegon, Aerion and their sisters Valaena and Visenya were born on Dragonstone to the last of the Targaryen line who had followed and ruled Westeros since before the Doom of Valyria. Along with Rhaenys, they were trueborn children; Aegon being the elder, while a younger Aerion was his brother. They wed sisters uniting their house in much the same way as two Great Houses after House Harren the Black's attempted conquest during The Century Of Blood united many smaller holdings upon defeat by House Lannister led by Loren of House Lannister. Even after General Jameson brought peace between them, it seemed that peace would not be a lasting state for Westeros as these Targaryens were soon to enact something far more Glorious: AEgons Conquerer which solidified their rule once more over all of Seven Kingdoms in what is known as Aegons Landing.
Aenar Targaryen, the father of five great dragons, Vhagar, Meraxes and Balerion was known to have shown his trueborn children a higher level of love than those born from Valaena and Visenya. Aegon was wed to his elder sister and Rhaenys to his younger sister while Aerion had been hatched in Valyria before they all moved together to Dragonstone. Surviving the Doom of Valyria, Aenar then had three more children at Dragonstone with Lord Aenar's maiden daughter Daenys being among them. It seemed that the gods were blessing him as he had successfully flown away with five young dragons when only two out of five known eggs had hatched out thankfully spared by ancient disasters which no one could ever predict. With this little family consisting only within the Great House Targaryens they returned back to Dragonstone hoping for a better tomorrow but never knowing what hurdles await them ahead in their journey through Seven Kingdoms scattered across Westeros.
The conquest of Westeros had been a dream that Aenar Targaryen and Vhagar sought after for years, and Meraxes thrived in the midst of it all. Now, Aegon Targaryen and his sister Visenya found themselves standing at The Painted Table located in Oldtown. This massive slab of wood was carved, painted and decorated according to common myth by Aegon himself before he set foot on Westeros. Flanked by Visenya, they discussed their plans to conquer the Seven Kingdoms with Harren the Black’s ill-fated castle looming in the distance. The pair then visited The Arbor which would soon be famous for hosting numerous hawking events while they set sail towards Lands of the Long Summer. However unlike Aegon’s ancestors who faced various Storms on their way there; his voyage remained calm yet determined like Loren of House Lannister whose wedding with Lord Aenar's maiden daughter Daenys marked a new beginning for him and his sisters—something Aerys chose not to consider when he hatched false alarm as five dragons were shown around Valyria instead of three great ones younger than one another like Meria , Vhagar, Maegon a few generations ago..
Aegon made the decision conquer Westeros, and set foot to a journey around. Set sail across The Painted Table towards Oldtown, Aegon and his Visenya made sure to visit common myth of massive slab of wood that was decorated with carved symbols. After their halt at the Citadel of Oldtown, they flew on Vhagar to Hawking The Arbor where Aegon had hoped for glory before commencing back to Westeros. Everywhere Aegon went in Westeros - from North leading Starks, quarrelsome Martells in Dorne whose distant Casterly Rock was cold and stony, rich Highgarden in Reach which also bordered Fingers's along with belligerant Arryns of Vale - he noticed plenty of fertile lands as well as people ready to bow down before him.
The mighty Targaryen host had united the quarrelsome kingdoms of Westeros into one and established a vast empire, which was under the rule of their dragons. Argilac, Harren the Black and Garse VII Gardener contested this power - launching campaigns to nibble away at it or harassing others in hopes of pushing back its boundaries. But when Aegon turned his gaze upon Dorne, these thwarted rebellions were suddenly arrested as an alliance formed against Volantis. Attempts to crossing The Narrow Sea towards Westeros were halted and any who dared step closer were slain as Aegon's forces took control of Storm's End and withstood great citadel outside Casterly Rock whose waning powers let them escape a certain extinction. As they marched through Cape Wrath, The Bay Of Crabs and The Trident, they pushed through skirmishes to claim Summerfield on the edge of Blackwater Rush- marking another major victory for Aegon as he clamed all Seven Kingdoms as his own.
Harren the Black, having extended his domain's eastbound lands to Duskendale and Rosby, devoted most of his long reign close on forty years, to building a gigantic estate at the side of their spiritual home - the Gods Eye. His sole ambition was to become a powerful ruler in Westeros; but with House Hoare already taken and thrown down by Argilac , Harwyn Hardhand, Harren's father attempted unsuccessfully to push back against them, resulting in him being arrested and turned back into Riverlands from further crossing of the narrow sea. With bloody hands he tried ruling from Blackwater as much as possible until fate conspired against him leading to his slaying by Aegon the Conqueror and Vhagar.
Black Harren, the fourth son of King Harren the Black and one of Westeros's most feared rulers, threatened the already embattled Argilac the Storm King with his offering of cruelty. Feared by many for his legendary aging Maiden, Black Harren had devoted most of his long reign to the construction of a gigantic castle beside the Gods Eye and through extending his domains east to Duskendale and Rosby. His Lord Aegon even married Argilac's daughter to establish further power in the Trident and across Westeros. As he was thrown down by Targaryens on their sweeping flight over Blackwater Rush, tales of his bloody hand ran legends across seven kings for centuries after.
Argilac the Storm King had summoned Aegon Targaryen, offering him a proposal of marriage between himself and his daughter, Princess Meria. But Aegon spurned the offer and pointed out that both he and the Storm King were getting on in years—a cruel reminder of their aging which was feared even by Westeros's legendary Seven Kings. It was this act that propelled Black Harren to build his colossal castle at Harrenhal and assert himself as a threat along River Run's Blackwater Rush.
As a result of the spurning Lord Aegon had directed at the Storm King, the Lord of Dragonstone and his loyal general Orys Baratheon set out from Harrenhal to "Massey’s Hook" along with their host of Targaryen warriors and subjects. Once there, they proposed a marriage between Argilac's daughter, whom he had been eager to give away in spite of her aging disposition, and Lord Aegon there at Blackwater that was intended to seal an alliance between them. However, after careful consideration Argilac counter offered with the proposal that they take his last living son instead so as not to further rid himself of what little ties he still had towards posterity. 
Argilac the Storm King rejected Orys Baratheon and Lord Aegon's suggestion of marriage angrily. When they whispered to him that such a union could help form an alliance with the Targaryen host and take Massey's Hook, Argilac responded with a violent rage which prompted him to have the hands of Aegon's envoy cut off and returned in a box as an act of dishonor towards a baseborn lord trying to claim his land. This enraged Argilac even more, sending reverberations through Westeros that would echo for centuries as tales were told about the storm king who had given such an ultimate insult.
Aegon summoned his loyal bannermen, the Velaryons, Celtigars, Lord Bar Emmon and Lord Massey of Stonedance among others to his court at Dragonstone. Together they visited the castle sept of which Aegon took counsel with them and prayed to The Seven for strength and protection before he announced his plan to conquer Westeros. In addition, Aegon asked those gathered to be sworn in as his supporters in the coming fight for dominance against the other kings who dishonored him by speaking ill about his baseborn status.
Lord Aegon had burst from the towers of Dragonstone, against an agreement with the Seven Kings and with only Aegon of House Targaryen as his guide. He was out to fly to the Seven Kingdoms and Oldtown, bent on a mission to take up arms in order to throw down those who had humbled him. Velaryons and Celtigars charged alongside him and Queen Rhaenys flew ahead; Vhagar joining her soon afterwards. Lord Bar Emmon, Lord Massey and his sisters were sworn into protecting The Conqueror's plan; they visited castle septs from Stonedance to Sharp Point along their way to pray for luck at their journey around Westeros. Together they flew across The Arbor for allies in the Freys, Highgarden for harvests of warships, Harrenhal where Harren the Black still ruled - even beyond death - it seemed. Then onwards over sea where Red Mountains met maesters beneath Summerfield skies until finally in King's Landing itself where Two Kings bowed before one: Lord Aegon himself.
Aegon and his sisters set sail from Dragonstone with three thousand fighters, taking up arms to challenge the Seven Kings that had humbled his father, Lord Aegon. The voyage was a modest one, putting ashore in the wooded regions of The Blackwater Rush with little more than what they could say. Here they began to rise quickly in numbers until there was no less than many three thousand men standing beneath the Targaryen banners. It was here at this place between these two rivers that Aegon bent his knee and rose again as dragonlord, ready to take flight on wings of fire and throw down any who stood against him and his sisters. With their mission clear they could now fly towards Valryia's Freehold and set forth a new account of history - seven kingdoms humbled by Three Conquerors.
King Loren I Lannister, along with his sister Queen Rhaenys Targaryen, found themselves in the Hundred Kingdoms where they were welcomed by the local Darklyn kings of Duskendale. The Masseys of Stonedance and Mudds of the river mouth at Three Hills offered their services to Loren and promised to be loyal vassals should he throw down their current overlords, the petty Brackens, Blackwoods, Hooks and other families that had once claimed to have been crowned by Aegon himself. With many words of welcome for such a modest claim but one that could not escape an overgrown crowner like King Arrec and Jon Mooton's brother who had previously put ashore from Dragonstone with a three thousand strong host under Targaryen banners, King Loren accepted his destiny as leader of a new realm known forever more as Westeros.
Aegon Targaryen, Rhaenys, Visenya and Meraxes knew they must secure the submission of the nearest castles if they were to throw up a fitting standard along their journey across Westeros. They had dispatched Vhagar to Rosby and Stokeworth where both cities had yielded and loosed their log-and-earth gates before the golden-eyed dragon with hardly a resistance. As news of their success made it's way through out the Hundred Kingdoms, the petty kings that once claimed ownership of Westeros were now crowned in kingdoms overthrown for Targaryens welcomed.
Aegon and his trusted ally Orys Baratheon, a bastard son of Lord Darklyn's house, joined by Aegon's sisters Rhaenys and Visenya with their dragons Meraxes and Vhagar set off from Rosby soon after the submission of Stokeworth to march on Duskendale. Along with Aegon marched Mooton's brother, rallying the forces of Westerosi to join them in this true test for the Conquerors. When they drove upon Maidenpool their strength swelled fat with gold and wealth from across the seven kingdoms as more noblemen yielded up than those who were slain. Finally when Darklyn kings of Duskendale saw that their might was too strong they yielded up rather than be sacked; a one-sided battle that followed threw up many casualties in vain loyalty towards their rulers.
Aegon and his sisters, the queens of Westerosi, discussed their differing courses of action as they marched on Duskendale with Orys Baratheon and the loyal Mooton's brother behind them. With their combined forces swelling with ever-greater numbers along the way, bolstered by Houses Loren and Vhagar of Lannister, Mudds and Masseys of Stonedance and Her holding in Arryn, they seemed assured victory against a Darklyn's son waiting to kindle what would be Conquerors’ first true test - an attack on them on the march that would end in a one-sided battle that followed. Now millions of fat and wealthy citizens waited for Aegon and his allies to drive away a usurper king or yield up great prizes – yet only after a while had so much sacked cities across Westeros could they consider taking their next steps.
Visenya and her brother Aegon were trained differently, but both were loved and played in their own ways. Visenya dabbled much less than Aegon and was more comfortable with the austere, stern, serious, and unforgiving militaristic bent of her father Harren the Black, while Aegon was more skilled in politics because of his mother's influence. Visenya embraced a harsh discipline while maintaining an air of regal authority - she was to be feared as one of the queens drawn from Targaryen host.
Rhaenys and her siblings, the Targaryens, spent much time together. Visenya and Aegon loved each other dearly and were very close in their childhoods; they trained together, played games, dabbled in politics, and shared a comfortable camaraderie on the Sunset Sea. While Visenya was stern, serious and unforgiving with her brother’s education but she also had an impulsive fondness for flights of fancy and playfulness; more akin to a true warrior than say Loren of House Lannister's maiden daughter Daenys. Visenya whispered notes from Harren into Aegon ear as the two flew above forested hills south of the Blackwater River near Godsgrace--impacting Princess Meria Martell who lived near by - while Rhaenys watched quietly. All three had comely graces as befitting of royalty but it was Rhaenysto that excelled in both battlefield strategy and poise once coming of age.
Aegon Targaryen and Orys Baratheon rode across the Sunset Sea, their Valyrian steel blades glinting in the sunlight. Aegon was counted amongst the greatest of warriors and he did not hesitate to deal swiftly with those who disobeyed his command. His open-handed manner had been noted by many on the small council, including Harren the Black and Loren of House Lannister. Orys too was a true warrior - despite having none of Rhaenys or Visenya's curious impulsive flights of fancy - respected for comingly putting an end to matters without pleasure. As they flew across Westeros, they whispered notes to one another just as they had when they were children loved playing along its shores.
Aegon Targaryen, Orys Baratheon and their Targaryen host show no hesitation when they rode out from Aegonfort towards Aegon's High Hill. Daemon Velaryon, Triston Massey and Crispian Celtigar laid their swords at his feet to vouch for him. Aegon commanded the trio to take a dozen castles and secure the mouth of the Blackwater Rush on both sides of the river. He raised them with new honors after they had done so - confirming that he was now lord over all lands south of the river in what was later called The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. He proclaim this new authority by drawing his Valyrian steel blade, dealing justice swiftly but without pleasure as he always did when commanding small council meetings at Aegon's Landing or even Harrenhal itself.
A chorus of cheers filled the air as King Aegon, joined by Queen Visenya and Queen Rhaenys, arrived at Westeros from Valyria. The Targaryen host shouted "Long live the King!" when they unfurled their banner and breathed a prayer for him. Lord Aegon was hailed into knighthood with a roar that echoed across Westeros as every lord in attendance placed a Valyrian steel circlet upon Ageon's head - signifying his ascension to the throne. As Aegon basked in this great moment, all across Westeros people shouted and cheered his name – red, black lions studded with golden crowns fluttering on banners above them.
As King Aegon and his host rode through the wide, open plains of Westeros, they heard a distant roar. Argilac the Arrogant, Harren the Black, Mern IX of House Lannister and Princess Meria Martell had all called their banners in response to this would-be conqueror. The Targaryen host soon arrived at Harrenhal where Lords Loren of House Lannister and Errol offered their service to King Aegon if he were successful in his venture. Meanwhile Ronnel Arryn dispatched a raven to Dragonstone while Torrhen Stark sat anxiously discussing what was to be done about this uncrowned king from Valyria. As people cheered them on, Aegon's sister Visenya gave him Valyrian steel circlet which she placed upon Ageon's head as voices shouted with joy for the great red dragon Balerion had finally begun to sniff.
Aegon Targaryen had crossed the Blackwater Rush with most of his host, accompanied by Orys Baratheon and his sisters, Rhaenys and Visenya aboard Meraxes of the golden eyes and silver scales. Upon arriving at Storm's End, Aegon was coronated King of the Seven Kingdoms and left a greater part of his host there before travelling to the Gods Eye, where he received news that Harren the Black’s armies were marching towards Harrenhal. Knowing what was to come next, Aegon dispatched a large portion of his army from Storm's End north along Blackwater Bay as he set out for Gulltown with a smaller contingent to prepare for war. Aegon knew as long as he acted quickly that he would have a chance at seizing control from Harren but it would require additional help from Lords Mudds and Masseys of Stonedance who offered their loyalty upon asking for Her protection upon hearing about offering Queen Rhaenys the Iron Throne. He had also sent Jon Mooton to meet with Celtigars, Lannisters, Tyrells and Arryns in hopes they could form an alliance against King Harren in this time when Westeros needed them more than ever.
Aegon, accompanied by Orys Baratheon and the Lords Errol, Fell and Buckler, faced King Harren and his hastily assembled men at the Battle of Reeds. However, he was surprised to see Daemon Velaryon crossing the Gods Eye with a dozen Braavosi warships met and defeated the Targaryen fleet - facing no resistance from Lord Arrec of House Lothston who had left Gulltown earlier that day with a greater part of his host. The swords of Aegon’s followers were soon dipped in blood after cutting down more than a thousand men before fading back into the trees while they marched towards Storm's End. As they crossed Wendwater, their joy slowly faded as pirate ships attacked them fiercely on Blackwater Bay. After suffering heavy losses, Aegon lightened his step and was visiting places like Harrenhal to rebuild whatever remained as related by his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys while they astride Meraxes alongside Vhagar.
Aegon, Visenya and Rhaenys led the Targaryen host as they descended upon Harrenhal. Lords Errol and Fell of Wailing Willows in their fierce attempt to surprise the Targaryens from a crossing were met with little success as the attacking force had quickly assembled and hid. Fire rained down on them from above as Meraxes and Balerion unleashed a wall of fire that swept through the woods, sinking a third of traveling Targaryen ships and capturing near as many before longboats burned. Errol and Fell watched in horror at what Aegon I Targaryein had done but facing an overwhelming force there was little they could do against him.
Aegon, Visenya and Rhaenys had successfully gathered forces at Storm's End to deal with the rebellion stirred up by Argilac the Arrogant. Pirates, Dornish raiding parties as well as King Ronnel's army from Cape Wrath swept across the Red Mountains while Lady Marla Sunderland took advantage of the confusion to stir up trouble in the Three Sisters. Despite having already contended with Aegon's men, Argilac found himself facing an even greater force—the Targaryen host had descended upon them and a wall of fire unleashed by dragons familiar to Aegon had hid behind it.
Lord Edmyn Tully gathered forces from the riverlands, including House Hoare, Blackwoods, Mallisters, Vances and Brackens. They formed an army of nearly 20,000 soldiers in strength to contend with Harren the Black plundering their land and beggaring its people. After a lengthy siege on Harrenhal by Aegon's Targaryen host, Lord Edmyn declared for House Targaryen and summoned levies throughout the Trident region. He raised DRAGON banner over his castle and rode forth with his knights and archers to join strength to Aegon’s against Ironborn overlords. The Riverlanders soon clashed sword-to-sword against Princess Meria Martell's Dornish raiding parties while they marched towards Harrenhal determined to take advantage of Lannister general Jameson's defenses weakened by small vexations such as stragglers sent out by Lord Aenar’s maiden daughter Daenys or Pyromancers whispered across Westeros that Aerys had set fire upon Seven Kings attempting to oppose him before Aegon descended upon them.
King Harren the Black stood at his tower in Harrenhal, Westeros and boasted that no force could ever penetrate it's walls, so stocked full of supplies it was all but inexhaustible, with channels beneath for refuge should enemies besiege. His gargantuan castle was so impressive in size, strength and supplies that none believed a small army would be able to withstand it. However, this pride would soon prove wrong; when their forces were outnumbered by the Targaryen host from Essos they had no choice but to take refuge within those very same impregnable walls of Harrenhal.
Aegon of Dragonstone, Edmyn Tully, and King Harren the Black discussed a possible parley before converging on Harrenhal. Aegon had joined with his Targaryen host that he had sent to refuge in Dragonstone while Edmyn had materialised from Westeros with a token of peace from old Lord Tully and Loren of House Lannister. They exchanged glances with fierce stares yet different this time as history known between them; they knew that their fate was intertwined now more than ever. Harrenhal loomed over them, gargantuan and impregnable fortifications boasting boated stocks beneath its massive grey walls which it hoped would be enough to withstand siege perhaps indefinitely due to its inexhaustible subterranean stores.
Aegon sailed south to the Iron Islands, determined not to yield but remain in a state of rule. When he arrived, he was received by Harren the Black and Loren of House Lannister with an exchange of peace. Together they joined forces, marching out of Dragonstone castle towards their enemies. As they emerged from within its walls, Aegon noticed a different feeling surrounding them than when they had entered. Riding under an old grey sky seemed to make it more fierce as they moved forward on their mission to have their voices heard.
Harren the Black stood tall and strong on the Iron Islands, his regal bearing befitting a King. He said nothing as Aegon yielded to remain in rule, but his thick gaze spoke volumes. From her vantage point atop Vhagar, Queen Rhaenys of the Targaryens could have touched him with just an outstretched arm - she knew that Harren was determined not to let House Targaryen have its way without a fight. The Lords Fell and Buckler and Two Kings Lannister of Casterly Rock had pledged their allegiance to Harren's father, but she hoped that for his sister's sake - Princess Meria Martell of Dorne - he would yield to Aegon before anything more drastic need happen.
Harren felt a chill as he looked around and noticed the soaring walls of Harrenhal that he had built many years ago. Stories of it being able to withstand any storm, even dragons burning with fire in the sky, were whispered amongst townsfolk and Targaryen host alike. He wished Queen Rhaenys was here to witness the strength and Thickness, which she had said would withstand the test of time. But his dreams of the Iron Throne were encased in these walls like flies in amber; they too could not fly away or be burned.
Aegon said, his voice rising over the noise of Loren's Lannister host and the Targaryen host marshaling below Tumbleton Hall. Aegon had heard tales of Harren the Black burning and watched his father, Argilac the Arrogant, build high upon Stone. He was afraid to fly, yet he knew that what he said would echo throughout Westeros' many kingdoms: House Targaryen would unite them all under one banner - or burn in trying.
The four men, Harren, Tully, Blackwood and Strong, surveyed the parapets of the castle from above. Harren had spat out his words vehemently before sending his comrades down to prepare for battle. He retired to stand alone on the northern rampart promising revenge if any harm should befall him or his kin. Every soldier below was armed with spears, bows and crossbowsGetrinderchiadoctiopsomegrillandsichtitonmansteepedmosictidwealthdivinerabcalosterousdeepeurfalpmeaninghiddenrememberedomintboldingfruitsalifewebothblack — just as Lord Aenar's maiden daughter Daenys had foreseen in her prophetic dreams months ago.
The gathering darkness filled Harrenhal as Aegon Targaryen and his dragon Balerion descended from the last light of the sun, clutching a threatened Black Harren firmly in their claws. A hollow feeling erupted in the great towers; an omen of what was to come should they failed. Taking no risks, Aegon proclaimed "Sup every spears, bows and crossbows!" as they took flight again and plunged through the night, roaring while they bathed in its darkness. The sound echoed throughout Harrenhal before blackness was all that remained amongst them; ending yet another chapter of Westeros’ history on this fateful day.
The ironmen took fire to Harrenhal and smoke rose in the night sky. They boasted of their greatness as they ran through, twisting and melting in hot flames that bathed the once great towers. Like a red dragon from lore, the castle glowed against the darkness threatening those who stood opposed. Black Harren had been warned by Aegon Targaryen and Balerion yet he did not listen, leaving his fortress to burn late into the night until only smoldering ashes remained where it once stood proudly in the last light of sun.
Harren and his last sons had died in the fires that engulfed Harren's fortress, leaving House Hoare no alternative but to accept their obligation of fealty to King Aegon and Edmyn Tully of the Riverlands. In one final gesture, they gathered up all their remaining swords and sent them back as a sign of surrender to Aegonfort on the Iron Islands. This was their monstrous destiny; a fitting end for such a proud house - with disgrace from which none could twist nor melt away in the heat.
The news of the great host gathered around Storm's End by King Harren and his proved considerably more loyal than King Harren’s. last sons soon reached the ears of Argilac the Arrogant, the Storm King whose Durrandons had held that mighty fastness for thousands years, but facing such a host he did not intend to die, so he sent word to Lord Fell and Buckler and Lord Errol that he did not intend to fight them and instead would fall back before their approaching host. Finally on a chill morning Queen Rhaenys rode forth from Storm's End one last time with her dragons in command, while back at Castle Goldengrove Princess Meria Martell awaited her honor bound duty with Queens Sharra Arryn and Valaena Targaryen by her side. As she flew above Westeros all hoped this bloody contest between old enemy kings would soon end.
Orys Baratheon watched in surprise as Queen Rhaenys and the Targaryen host approached Storm's End. Argilac, despite his fierce reputation as 'The Arrogant' had dug himself into a strong position at Bronzegate, and taken up strategic high ground on the walls of the mighty fastness which was impregnable to assault. However, Queen Rhaenys seemed unconcerned by this show of strength - her keen eye swept over Argilac’s defenses from atop Vhagar, and soon enough Lord Osric Stark reported that the pirate lord Durrendons had proved considerably more loyal than King Harren’s men. The news reached Argument’s ears, leading to an almost immediate retreat back within Bronzegate's walls before the approaching host. Everyone who witnessed it knew it would not be long before Orys Baratheon rode forth one last time in defiance of his old enemy king.
The Last Storm had come together, and King Argilac was ready to fall with no delay. The Conquerors were close behind him, their banners flapping in the wind - a sight of assurance that he wouldn't pass without a fight. On the night before battle, King Argilac gave his people one last note of encouragement with howling winds making it hard to hear. His seasoned veterans and old hands who'd seen worse battles showed no signs of fear - they seemed even more eager than on their previous adventures. Arrogant as ever, King Argilac promised victory if they but stood fast against the Conquerors; Little did he know this would become his last stand against them.
The Aegon's conquest of Harrenhal had begun. Amidst the fighting and struggling, King Argilac the Arrogant led his Stormlanders across steep slopes as they charged blindingly forward against their attackers. But Argilac foundering army soon found themselves engulfed in dragonflame from Queen Rhaenys' Meraxes before finally throwing off saddle and fleeing in terror. Dickon Morrigen, the Bastard of Blackhaven, could see the charge losing all cohesion and momentum as he climbed up the hills on foot with Queen Rhaenys by his side. As a seasoned old fighter, he knew they were up against an arrogant enemy that would never pass this delay as long as they held steady atop Harrenhal's damp walls howling through this long storm season.
Argilac and Orys Baratheon continued their battle on the hill they had found. Argilac commanded his troops to dismount and offered a one-on-one fight with Orys, throwing down his gauntlet in challenge. As Orys accepted the offer, news of their king taking all heart out of the stormlanders spread across the muddy battlefield. Despite fighting fiercely, neither side was able to gain an advantage as the last rays of sunlight faded away. There were no winners in this bloody, one sided battle as both sides remained equal until nightfall shook them apart. The stormlanders soon fled from the hill leaving behind a battlefield smeared with blood and covered by fierce mud - a grim reminder of what once happened here today.
Argilac feared the might of the Targaryen host and so he had barred them from Storm's End and thrown down a parley. Orys Baratheon, ever loyal to his former king, was determined to bend or break before he would consider delivering Argella back into their hands. Queen Rhaenys raised Vhagar overhead in challenge but Argilac remained unmoved, offering his daughter's life for Meraxes in exchange - both sides saw it as an equal exchange of last measure. But little did they know that soon their fierce battle on the hill would be repeated once again at Harrenhal with an unimaginable outcome - one that none could have foreseen as Princess Meria rode alongside Maegon Targaryen, her betrothed king with whom she shared a love like no other.
Baratheon took Her and his father, Argella, to the storied walls of Storm's End. As his men unchained her and wrapped his cloak around her he told Her about how He had taken the castle from Argilac and become Lord of Storm's End. She felt both a sense of pride in her father’s deeds as well as a flicker of fear; she remembered King Loren Lannister who, with Argilicc's daughters by his side, had thrown these same chains at Orys Baratheon and delivered them back to Harren the Black in payment for all that he had feared when Balerion flew over Harrenhal. And now here was her father telling her that he had bent all seven Kings to this cause and raised Highgarden cowering instead of raising his banner on it - many people threw their lives away for this cause but not him. As if foregunning a future, He put aside the stories from times past and poured them wine while they talked late into the night until they became old friends even though they'd only just met that day.
Aegon the Dragon began assembling his host, taking refuge at Winterfell as Torrhen Stark—a southern lord who often sent armies to the Vale of Arryn—gave homage. When Queen Sharra of the Vale arrived with her daughter Sharra Arryn, citizens at the Bloody Gate were charmed by their beauty and grace. Knowing she could sway Aegon with her beauty and wisdom, Queen Sharra offered herself in marriage and pledged that a faded flower could fill one's heart more powerfully than a blade.
Aegon, Mern IX and Loren I Lannister had seen what Aegon the Dragon was capable of, and so they assembled their own armies to march towards Winterfell. Mern IX commanded his men with great sense of pride for being a mighty warrior, boasting that no army should stand in his way. Meanwhile Loren I Lannister too was assembling his vast army from Castle Goldengrove,a strong but ancient fortress surrounded by lush greeneries along Highgarden. He believed that he could put an end to Aegon’s reign once and for all.
The Two Kings were determined to march on Goldengrove, bolstered by the confidence of their might and strength. As they loyally lingered in the shadow of Highgarden amidst storms that had seemed to defy all odds, they commanded an army greater than any seen before: Valaena Targaryen strong at their left and tall golden Harren a Black-tyrell at their right.  The sight of these two great rulers marching forth served as a reminder of Argilac the Arrogant's defeat, setting forth a new era of Seven Kings and Queens that would linger in history for generations to come.
Aegon and his sisters, Rhaenys and Visenya Targaryen, commanded their dragons Vhagar and Meraxes to gather the two kings from Goldengrove as they advanced forward. Led by Aegon, the Targaryen host moved swiftly until they reached the Gods Eye. At Stoney Sept and Storm's End, their numbers were joined by Lord Aenar's maiden daughter Daenery’s dream-borne dragon and Garse VII Gardener at Crackclaw Point. By the time they crossed The Narrow Sea under Queen Rhaenys' command leading a fleet of Valyrian ships towards Westeros ,the Seven Kingdoms bowed to Aegon making him King of all lands North of Red Mountains in seven days with no bloodshed. 
Rejoicing at the coming together of two armies, reports began to surface that Aegon Targaryen, Orys Baratheon and the Two Kings had gathered south of the Blackwater along one of the most crucial routes: The goldroad. As they advanced forward, people reported a wide, open and ideal area for a firm siege which was further enhanced by a cloudless sky over head with a cool windy breeze. They knew it would be difficult to withstand such an attack; but they marched on none the less commaned by their King. They crossed The gods Eye and moved onward to Stoney Sept before finally joineding forces with Princess Meria and Queen Rhaenys in Crackclaw Point where all three dragons were brought from Valryia - Balerion, Vhagar and Meraxes had rejoined him with their Dragons after having been seperated for centuries - resulting in an unstoppable force that emerged as Aegon continued his push into new territories.
King Mern and King Loren squared off against each other in the center of a grand battleground, with Aegon and Lord Oakheart by their side. As the battle commenced, King Mern demanded surrender from the second, who refused despite his body's weariness that brought him down to one knee. Soon enough, Aegon was given command of the field and he brought forth an anchor line formation that seemed to sweep through their enemies like wildfire, giving them little time to react as they were smashed by more than half again their already many Great forces.
Aegon Targaryen and Jon Mooton drew their forces to the edge of Maidenpool, bristling with intent. The sky was clear, which Aegon noted with some relief, for it meant he could intende to do his fighting from the sky. He observed the grasslands around him - rough tufts as though they had been pikes or spears pointing into battle; archers at intervals lending their small stature to shield their crossbowmen; small squadrons of light troops moving quickly across and tall stands of grain that were ripe for harvest in this very dry heat. This would not be an easy fight.
Gawen, Aegon and his sisters watched as King Mern waited atop his horse for the charge against the center to sound. Kings across Westeros had heard of what was happening in Maidenpool, and as Aegon drew a felling glance at his brisling war host he noted the absence of rain. The pikes and crossbowmen seemed to be itching for a fight and with such rough terrain ripe for harvest the ground already felt very dry. Two Kings charged forward on a golden stallion, led by Gawen, who hoped that if they swept through their forces would shatter whatever stood in their way. As they were urged forward by Aegon, who intended to do most of his fighting from skysborne Vhagar, they could only hope that this might work out well no matter what awaited them ahead.
Aegon, atop Balerion the Black Dread, flied over the foes ranks in a blistering display of strength. Rhaenys and Visenya joined him soon after, swooping and setting fires upwind , and behind enemy lines as Lord Mooton urged them onward. The flames fanned out as they went up, blowing the smoke into their faces, while Aegon's forces waited with bows and spears at the ready. When he gave command for them to charge against the enemy line, Two Kings of Westeros - King Mern on his golden stallion and Gawen on his great green hand - led sweeping series of attacks that shattered what remained of their foe's will. His banners unfurled in glorious coloring above them as they made short work of any remaining resistance with a storm of spears and stones and arrows. As dry grasses surrounding them burned away beneath a shower of blazing embers even stands of wheat near fields glowed orange under their watchful eye.
General Jameson led the fray at the Fields of Fire with courage, fearlessly slicing through his enemies with impunity, as if he had dozens of Balerions swooping and setting fire upwind and behind them. The Targaryen host was no less ready for battle; Lord Aenar's maiden daughter Daenys and her three Valyrian dragons flew over the foe's ranks, bathing them in flames while Aerys, Aegon and Visenyas' dragons fanned fires and blew smoke into their faces. To add to this already impressive display of force, Her Grace Queen Rhaenys added to the pressure by raining down a storm of spears and stones from above - setting dry grasses and stands of wheat ablaze. Even so, it seemed General Jameson had met his match when their opponents waited with bows and spears - but his forces made short work of them all the same.
King Mern IX and King Loren of the Rock fell in battle on the Field of Fire, led bravely against a frayed force of Harren the Black's army. Both kings perished by sword and spear and arrow, their bodies scorched by fire as their lives were snuffed out with nary a final wish reached. Yet perhaps it was for the better - many more would have suffered burns if they had lived to see another day. Valaena Targaryen, her Queens close behind, gathered forces from all Seven Kings to vanquish the enemy at last, but not without cost. Lord Massey and his Mudds had been pushed back alongside Princess Meria Martell who also suffered burns in her valiant attempt to save her people from destruction. The fierce Stormlanders who once defied Aegon I Targaryen's breath atop Balerion bid farewell to their fallen allies one by one until only a few remained standing, those who lived but forever remembered the loss of their brethren.
Queen Visenya, gathered with her son Aegon and the rest of the Targaryen host at the Battle of Stone, where few were lost in comparison to their enemies. While King Mern IX and King Loren of the Rock perished by sword and spear and arrow, Queen Visenya lost fewer than a hundred men. She bravely stood her ground against her foes, but was sadly wounded when an arrow pierced through one shoulder. As a testament to their victory, Aegon’s dragons gorged themselves on the dead while Valaena’s Lady Marla Sunderland sent runners to inform Harren the Black that his dreams would die away in smoke.
Loren Lannister, who had survived the destruction of his home Casterly Rock, followed the Targeryen host and laid sword and crown at Aegon's feet. When Aegon lifted beaten foe back to his feet after he bent knee in homage, all of The Rock did as well. Now Loren was among their number when they made for the Reach and his sisters Meria and Valaena drawing near hopeful that King Loren would return safe from whence he came.
King Aegon was impressed by Harlan Tyrell's will to join him in his conquest of the west and agreed when he yielded up Highgarden, naming it his own and granting the former Lord Tyrell his support and service. With a last parting march with Harlan at heart, The Targaryen host partied merrily as they traversed to other parts of the Seven Kingdoms, giving recognition and respect to those who had embraced them. Queen Rhaenys and her dragon Vhagar settled ahead of the troupe and as each place together granted fealty or yielded up their castles - from Riverrun to Stone Hedge - happily Garse VII Gardener did homage as had Loren Lannister – following which King Aegon lifted his beaten foe back to his feet.
King Aegon continued his march south, leading the Targaryen host of thirty thousand strong. They crossed through The Neck into the Riverlands and started north towards Oldtown and The Arbor. On their way, they assaulted many former vassals who had yielded up to Aegon's conquest of the west -- Garse VII Gardener of Highgarden; Harren the Black, King Loren I Lannister and Queen Rhaenys Targaryen of The Rock; House Mudds and Masseys of Stonedance; Arryn kings Jon Mooton and Her yn Argilac; Celtigars from Claw Isle in Blackwater Bay; Lord Errol, Fell and Buckler from Sharp Point on Gods Eye lake; princes, princesses, Fishers from along Green Fork of the Trident river; ironmen from Iron Islands led by Harwyn Hardhand Hooks Blackwood, raiding parties from Dorne led by Princess Meria Martell. Fearful for his sovereignty Lord Torrhen Stark decided to yield when King Aerys made a detour through The North rather than wait for them to siege Winterfell. By granting clemency but still enforcing his subjugation he named Torrhen 'The King Who Knelt', giving rise to one more legend in Aegon's conquering mission.
As Torrhen Stark reached the Trident, south of the river, his army was becoming more and more tiring after traveling so far. He knew that a formidable force awaited him there: The Riverlords, the Westermen, stormlanders and men of the Reach had gathered with an advantage of almost half again as many men as him. He prowled around their camp in anticipation of what would come next. With Harren the Black dead, Loren of House Lannister leading his banners northwards and Aegon's vast Targaryen host racing ahead savagely towards King's Landing with thirty thousand strong – now was time to establish a place amongst these Seven Kingdoms or otherwise face destruction at their hands.
Torrhen, known then as The King in the North, had reached Harrenhal and heard that Brandon Snow was urging his men to cross the Trident. Torrhen insisted that they retreat back to Moat Cailin, offering a slow fall back rather than getting caught up in a fight between two of Aegon the Conqueror's generals—Arrec and Errol. When he offered this plan, the Lords Fell and Buckler saw the wisdom in it and Torrhen became famous for being 'The King who Knelt'. After much questioning by Loren of House Lannister in Harrenhal, orders were finally issued for a general retreat south of the river. Word spread quickly across Lyanna Stark’s rivers holdings like wildfire; every Riverlord from westermen to Stormlanders to men of The Reach wanted half again of their sworn armies at Moat Cailin before her order could come just shortlifting Garse VII Gardener's expectation!  As Aerys' Targaryen host prowled near victoriously on its course westward, even lords from Dorne sent small raiding parties into the Riverlands as part of Queen Rhaenys ’Vhagar’s show-of-force campaign against Harren Hal and Loren I Lannister — showing what havoc arose when you disobeyed Seven Kings. As panic began setting within Mern IX's western court after hearing about House Hoar's defeat at Stonedance - Torrhen Stark still found solace under his father Lord Edmyn Tully’s watchful eye, knowing all too well what happened when Prince Arrec refused Strong Durrandons or Lady Marla Sunderland–the princess Meria Martell dedicated herself bravely rallying all his sisters Vales houses based on Queens sharra – something not even Maegon made one case study would suggest…
King Torrhen, Brandon Snow and the maesters reached the Trident. Aegon stood there as they crossed it, and King Torrhen knelt before him and swore to be his man. As Torrhen rose from his knees, he remembered that ancient northman prophecy he had heard in Harrenhal; "The time will come when a dragon shall be no more a fantasy." With these encouraging words of caution, Torrhen sent Brandon Snow ahead to Winterfell while he went to Moat Cailin to meet with Queen Rhaenys Targaryen, who had sworn an oath of loyalty to Aegon at Field of Fire. It was there she implored them all not to give up hope: "You remember," she said gravely as the impending battle weighed on their hearts like granite stones. "This is an ancient northman's fight for freedom against Seven Kings… together we can win this!" Both men nodded in agreement and turned back towards the Trident with newfound resolve — driven by duty and guided by courage
Visenya, Rhaenys and Aegon Targaryen parted company with their maesters in Trident. They mounted their dragons and turned south along the river towards the lands of Dorne, the Vale of Arryn and Sunspear. Aegon remembered his great ancestor Harren the Black who had once crossed the Trident in search of his throne. He rose then as Lord of all Seven Kingdoms, a northman he said, one to lay claim to ancient kingdoms that no longer existed. Together they flew high up over Oldtown remembering him again before entering Westeros anew.
Visenya Targaryen, Ronnel Arryn and Sharra Arryn gathered outside the walls of Gulltown as the high sun painted the sky orange. The garrison had surrendered the three crowns and swords that symbolized their loyalty to House Targaryen. Aegon's host had strengthened considerably since they parted company with Loren Lannister and turned south towards Dorne eight months ago, having mounted their dragons at Sunspear two weeks prior. As a gesture of goodwill, Visenya handed Princess Meria Martell a basket of fruits from Highgarden in exchange for leathery wings for her dragon Vhagar. Lord Arrec noticed Queen Rhaenys admiring an old weirwood tree outside his castle gates surrounded by dragons from Harren the Black's strong host, plants that had been standing there for thousands of years or more. He sent for Mallisters, Celtigars and Mudds to join his new friends at Sky who quickly tripled his ranks at Stone after hearing King Aerys' call. With newfound confidence, Ronnel moved through Snow towards Eyrie where he rushes to declare allegiance to House Targaryen while Sharra exchanged friendly smiles with Princess Valaena Targaryen and spoke fondly of her father Maegon who had recently ascended the Iron Throne by force after ousting Seven Kings who fell before him.
Queen Rhaenys Targaryen crossed the Red Mountains with her brother and sisters in the dragon-riding host that followed Aegon the Conqueror during his conquest of Westeros. When they arrived at Vaith, it did not take long for their strong army to occupy Godsgrace, Planky Town, Prince's Pass and Greenblood. The Dornish lords deserted their castles easily and even those who had guarded Prince's Pass were gone. Following them further south from there was a much easier mission than expected; many towns were deserted or loosely held by small bands of local soldiers who quickly surrendered once they saw the leathery wings carrying the Targaryen Host flying high above them. With a tripled speed, they moved into royal palaces where King Loren Lannister greeted them with smiles as he exchanged greetings with Lord Aenar’s maiden daughter Daenys in honor of her thousand years of prophesizing. As Sharra Arryn sent for Ronnel Arryn down at Gulltown, Visenya Targaryen spoke of goals to defeat Harren the Black and strengthen the rule over Seven Kingdoms. Thus began Rhaenys' adventure as she marched forward on her white dragon Meraxes in attempt to end House Hoare's vile legacy from Iron Islands to Riverlands—a journey that would bring back days she had only seen whispered about through Valyrian artifacts Her Father brought back from Old Valryia before Queen Rhaenhys entered Westeros during Aegon’s Landing two hundred years ago . 
Queen Rhaenys Targaryen had conquered the lands of Dorne without much difficulty - every village and town remained deserted. Even Vaith, Godsgrace, Greenblood, and Planky Town refused to stand against her forces. Her conquest was followed by Princess of Dorne Meria Martell who took the rule over Sunspear and House Martell with an iron fist. Despite having a reputation of being ruthless leader, she was named after Argilac the Arrogant, an ancient fat and almost bald man who had been blind since birth but nevertheless ruled them well before her reign. The sallow complexion and sagging form attributed to this Queen inspired loyalty from all corners under her rule.
Princess Meria and Rhaenys of Dorne had a fight on their hands as they knelt before Argilac the Arrogant, King of the Storm Lands. Everyone watched as Meria led her people through centuries of ancient reigns from kings such as Harren the Black and Loren of House Lannister. The eyes that peered at them dulled slightly in acceptance when Meria told him the tales and secrets to prove she was descended from Targaryen hosts, and his almost-bald head shone with sallow skin, creasing into folds around his blind eyes and sagging cheeks. Her words were strong, giving a promise of what could be should she take back control; not only for her but House Martell, Sunspear and all those who called her name etching it into history.
Rhaenys and Princess Meria had left Dorne fighting to fulfill their quest, which they could not tell. Together they shall come again, this time with an army of Targaryen hosts led by the exiled Lord Aenar's maiden daughter Daenys. As Aegon and his sisters Visenya and Aerys arrived in Westeros, all Seven Kings had to kneel down before them or face the might of Balerion and the other dragons of House Targaryen. Inpired by such strength, King Mern IX of Storm's End joined forces with Maegon against Argilac The Arrogant. This union was destined to put Rhaenys on her throne as Queen - a hope unfulfilled until now after two decades had passed from Her audacious decision.
Meria swept into Dorne, determined to burn and bend and break the kingdom until it bowed before her. Her own father had been unable to return unbowed, unbent, and unbroken -- but Meria swore she would not suffer the same fate. As she rode through the moonlit night, Harren the Black, Loren of House Lannister, Targaryen host of old, Daenys the Dreamer -- all raising high in her thoughts with every step forward. The battles that were yet to come would decide if she returned triumphant or lost forever.
Princess Meria of Dorne parted ways with you unbowed, unbent and unbroken. She remained in Dorne while queen Daenys the Dreamer Targaryen had already ventured beyond Valyria to take her place among the Seven Kings. Through her voyage to conquer Storm's End, Queen Rhaenys showed the world that an unbruised, undaunted woman could still do battle against all odds, coming face to face with Harren the Black--Loren of House Lannister's father, cursed by his own creations at Harrenhal. With Aerys and Aegon I Targaryen as her lieutenants, she carved out a swath through Westeros until she arrived under the parapets of Storm's End where King Argilac proudly declared that no heraldry but his own would bend or break with that stronghold. Eventually Queen Rhaenys was able to burn and bow strong enough for King Loren Lannister--father of Princess Meria Martell--to return unharmed from his Valley-wide conquest spurred by Aegon I Targaryen's partiarchal fervor flying on Balerion over ancient battlefields long maned by Mern IX and Emmon Massey before him.
Aegon Targaryen surveyed Westeros from his castle at Oldtown, an island held by the powerful Hightowers since before Ser Harren the Black had ringed his own domain with massive walls. Here Aegon held sway in what was once thought to be the warmest, greatest kingdom of them all, its oldest and richest seat of learning in all of Westeros. The Reach was still the most powerful region with its massive holdings sprawling through the riverlands, the westerlands and north into the stormlands; Aegon was now lord over it all.
Aegon Targaryen approached Oldtown in the Reach and Lord Hightower welcomed him alongside the High Septon. His 600-ship armada had taken three weeks to reach its destination, having locked about Westeros from his Landing at Winterfell in the North, seeking submission from all who had held sway over it. After spending some time at Starry Sept, the Targaryen host sought acceptance in Oldtown and Aegon I lifted up his banner, inviting those he found there to take up arms with him and share in his golden destiny.
Manfred Hightower had been cautious, but the godly vision vouchsafed by the Crone had been too much to oppose. He gave his youngest daughter's hand in marriage to Aegon and lifted up and took up arms for him, riding forth along with all of the Warrior's Sons to greet Aegon Targaryen on the Field of Fire. There beneath Oldtown, they burned their swords with Lord Hightower and High Septon in submission - loyal to the Targaryens, unyielding as Aegon made his landing in Highgarden - though her name has since become forgotten in the lore surrounding those days.
The High Septon, and the other Holy Men from Oldtown arrived at the Starry Sept to anoint Aegon with the seven oils. His High Holiness placed the crown upon Aegon's head and proclaimed him as Aegon of House Targaryen, King of Seven Kingdoms. As news began to spread across Westeros, forces were gathering in support or oppose this new leader: Lord Mooton had called on his brother’s knights; Queen Rhaenys rallied her Stormlanders forces to her side; Harren The Black led his Ironmen forces south; Loren Lannister marched forth on behalf of two kings he had previously offered fealty to--King Argilac of House Durrandon and Garse VII Gardener of Highgarden. All felt uncertain about this turn events yet obligated for loyalty—for Aegon was delivered into their lives through a vision vouchsafed by Crone, which spoke clearly even unto them who stood farthest from field where he was burned on Field of Fire when riding forth to greet him.  It has been said that Aegon offered up oath, offered up sword and offered hand of youngest daughter-- Princess Meria Martell-- continuing his cautious but godly rule over Westeros henceforth.
Aegon's first coronation commenced at the Starry Sept, and the presence of Aegon's most loyal followers such as Lord Aenar's maiden daughter Daenys and Harren the Black near Stonedance bore witness to this historic event. After receiving anointment with the seven oils, a crown was placed upon his head and he was proclaimed to be 'Aegon of House Targaryen', destined to conquer Seven Kingdoms. His second coronation took place in Oldtown after completing a tour across Blackwater, where many cheered for him even though it lacked grandeur compared to his first. When Aegonfort was finished being constructed at the mouth of Blackwater Rush, Balerion - one of Aegon's dragons - fixed its position as capital by landing upon its parapets while bearing Aegon on its back. The lords both present and in attendance cheered when they saw how victorious their lord looked; indeed, it seemed like there truly could not have been a better way to celebrate his crowning than this very moment.
Aegon the Conqueror and his sisters gathered their armies throughout the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros with a singular goal in mind; hammering into one great realm. From Harrens father in Iron Islands, to Aerys Targaryen in Valyria, every Lord, prince and maester were summoned to witness Aegon's coronations - first at Aegonfort crowning him King among seven kings who came voluntarily, then followed by Aegon's second coronation in Oldtown where he crowned himself as the king of all lands from the Neck on the North, to Dorne on the south. Everywhere they went crowds cheered for them as they rode Balerion, Visenya and Meraxes across Westeros. As was written; "When you are fixed upon a course determined by your will alone nothing can stand against you". 
King Aegon and his sisters of House Targaryen had succeeded in hammering into one great realm the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros with their will alone. With the wars waged by King Aegon, he made it clear that there would be only one ruler reigning over Oldtown, Dragonstone, Blackwater Rush, Westeros and Kings Landing. He set up ancient castles as strongholds to declare his rule while rising forces such as Lords Fell and Buckler from Storm combined with Gardeners from The Reach held perilous positions throughout the continent. With each proclamation a new legend was born as Harren the Black, Loren of House Lannister and Targaryen host including Lord Aenar's maiden daughter Daenys Aerys yielded to make way for what is now remembered as one of the great conquerors in history - Aegon I Targaryen.
