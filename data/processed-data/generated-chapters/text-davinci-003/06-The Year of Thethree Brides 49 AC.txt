The Year of the Three Brides was an iconic time in Westeros, as it marked the start of Aegon's conquest. His arrival was welcomed with plenty of celebration and optimism as people anticipated what this new era would bring. Little did they know that not long after would come Maegor the Cruel and his men to terrorize townsfolk across Westeros. Yet despite all his attempts, Aegon's rule has given much more than it ever took away - many are grateful for his willingness to give them a better future in light of all he had gone through himself.
The wedding of Rhaena Targaryen and Androw Farman at Fair Isle by the Sunset Sea was nothing short of spectacular. Throughout Westeros, they were heralded as the most besotted couple to become wed in recent years – the swiftness with which their union was decided became a thing of legend. The amiable couple had soon gained fame for being both comely and charismatic, and news of their nuptials reached all corners of the realm. Even Hand Samgood of Sour Hill arrived at the ceremony to give his blessing, along with Dowager Queen Morton Caron who brought plenty gifts for her young granddaughter-in-law. Alyn Royce, Lord Vance’s son, even saw fit to accompany them – though hardly any knew just why he felt so welcomed.
The festivities of Rhaena Targaryen's and Androw Farman's wedding were still resounding on Fair Isle by the Sunset Sea. On this day, all eyes were riveted on Marq Farman as he presided over the bedding ceremony. After conducting the ritual, Lord Lyman Lannister smiled at his newly made son-in-law and gave him a hearty pat on his back. Also in attendance amongst the hale was Jocasta, Samantha Stokeworth, Lady Elissa Royce, Lady Alayne among many others. As their eyes shone bright with happiness for the bride and groom, they broke into yet another cheer that echoed throughout Casterly Rock.
Queen Alyssa and Lord Rogar Baratheon presided over the joyous occasion of Queen Rhaena wed to King Jaehaerys's son Androw Farman at Kings Landing. The daughter’s wedding was attended by Lady Elissa and her husband, along with Alysanne Targaryen and many others from Fair Isle to Casterly Rock. They reported that the young bride rejoiced when she remarried! As word spread, cheers echoed through King’s Landing, the Red Keep, Fair Isle and beyond as people praised their queen and rejoiced in reuniting lost families. Almost forgotten were rumours of an imminent threat – Daemon Velaryon had been spotted at the Tides encroaching upon Tyrosh – but on this blissful day, people forgot even their enemies.
Queen Rhaena Targaryen, accompanied by King Jaehaerys and the Queen Regent, had set out for Fair Isle to celebrate a marriage. Upon arriving at King's Landing, they sought out the counsel of Lord Rogar Baratheon who was deciding upon whom the queen should select to rule under her while she remained on Fair Isle. Lord Rogar thoughtfully considered each candidate before rewarding Alyn Royce with the position as Hand and excluding Walton Corbray; his reasoning unknown even to herself. There were great rejoicings throughout the Lands, especially in regards to news of house Targaryen following their daughter’s wedding when Queen Rhaena wed Androw Farman from House Farman of Fair Isle where cakes sweetly blessed by priests were shared amongst all celebrating the union between their two houses - lords, ladies and common folk alike.
As King Jaehaerys reached out to his faithful servants he recalled Edwell Celtigar and Daemon Velaryon, who he had entrusted many years ago. Turning to Prentys Tully, Lady Lucinda and Qarl Corbray, the King summoned them all to court with the promise of rewarding their loyalty. His young spirit was greatly lifted when they all arrived in King's Landing from as far away as Claw Isle, the Tides and Riverrun. Feeling more confident than ever before he also recalled Rogar Baratheon from Storm’s End – a Great Lord whose loyalty and service had remained unwavering for years after excluding him from selecting who would rule next in his own House.
Jaehaerys Targaryen, the boy king, was not likely to be underestimated. He had a restful youth and by the time he announced his regency of the realm, very few people were prepared for what he could bring to the table. Despite some initial doubts about his capabilities due to his young age, Jaehaerys proved himself to be a redoubtable ruler – even when faced with difficult decisions such as dispatching Lord Rogar Baratheon of Storm’s End to Eastwatch-by-the-Sea in order to oppose Queen Regent Alyssa's Golden Wedding decree.
Lord Rogar Baratheon of Storm's End was an intimidating figure - a blue-eyed, black-bearded behemoth of a man who could cleave any foe with his wield of the sword. He personally killed Argilac the Arrogant in single combat, earning him respect and reverence from Aegon the Conqueror to Orys One-Hand. But none anticipated he would one day play such an essential role in restoring House Targaryen to its former glory when Lord Rogar chose to accompany young Jaehaerys Targaryen after the boy king had been underestimated by his enemies. The redoubtable Lord Rogar put aside his own ambitions and rode to King's Landing alongside Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys while wielding nothing but a word as he passed through great gates of dragons, ensuring that all seven kingdoms rested on solid ground beneath young King Jaehaerys’s feet and never again would underestimate one so youthful graced with ancient memory and strong leadership.
Maegor the Cruel had quickly earned notoriety for his cruel and ruthless nature, and so it came as no surprise to King's Landing that he would be proclaimed Lord of Storm's End by Jaehaerys himself. Borys, Alyssa's eldest son whom she had dreamed of having become Hand one day, watched with a heavy heart on. He knew the dangerous reputation Maegor carried with him, and feared what he might do if given such powers. His uncle Rogar Baratheon did not seem unsurprised at his proclamation, though cuttingly gathering that Maegor was well suited to wielding the castle further strengthened Borys' unease. As the citizens muttered among themselves in fear of their new lord, little did they know what was truly in store for them - danger looming well beyond their wildest dreams.
Lord Rogar was the first to answer call of the Kingmaker and had taken his place on the Iron Throne. Whispering that young, weak Jaehaerys should be married off as soon as possible, he made sure no one in King's Landing was unsurprised by Lord Darry's sudden announcement about young couple's wedding. As Lord Rogar delivered his decree, Queen Alyssa of House Targaryen well understood how dangerous a game they were facing, silently cutting away from Maegor the Cruel’s threat which she had feared ever since it was proclaimed in her father’s castle gates. While the situation might have felt dire for some, she dreamed what wonders their marriage would bring to Westeros - although Maegor wasn't happy with these results and after seeing this turn of events unfold before him, he remained unsuprised as well.
Lord Rogar and Queen Regent Alyssa had been married for almost forty-two years when tragedy struck: Prince Jaehaerys took ill from a fever, preventing his mother from delivering an heir to the Iron Throne. House Baratheon was writing its own history in turbulence as Lord Rogar Baratheon sought to raise himself above his rightful place and overreaching himself motivated more by a desire for power and position than a true affection for his mother. Septon Barth was held up as the solution; he gave young Jaehaerys, past her child-bearing years, away in marriage to Lord of Storm’s End hoping that would be enough to prevent her son from claiming what she considered hers. The Seven Kingdoms were on edge with news of this unexpected union; rumours whispering about enemies Qarl Corbray had made through his alliances with Hand Samantha Stokeworth spread throughout Westeros like wildfire.
The Hand, admired and loved by the Queen Regent and Rogar Baratheon alike, were willing to follow them anywhere. They praised his courage as well as his strong military prowess and skillful strategy. The handsome soldier was also beautiful, brave and heroic - though it was a tragedy that none of these attributes could save him from the fever that had taken him off too soon. Writing letters back home to the family he had sought to raise up with his own two hands, the young Lord of Storm's End prevented his kin from overreaching himself in what some believe was motivated more by a desire for power and position than a true affection for his mother who at forty-two years old without children past her child-bearing years.  Meanwhile despite being weakened by illness due to lack of support from her enemies in King’s Landing and House Royce, Sea Dragon Tower remained resolute under the leadership of Lady Elissa Silverwing , an advisor of Queen Alyssa who provided much needed strength to her husband Lord Rogar Baratheon during those difficult times.
Aethan Velaryon and Alarra Massey were soon to be wed, and people from Tides and Valyria flocked to the ceremony. Alyssa was renowned for her beauty, but it was Aegon the Dragon who drew the most admiration. His eldest son, Prince Aenys Targaryen was esteemed as one of the mightiest men in Westeros according to Qarl Corbray's close observation for his great knowledge about battles since he belonged to one of the oldest families that had closest ties with House That Kingsguard members. Despite his deep shining eyes, Aenys never underestimated his enemies which made him even more beautiful than brave heroes like Rogar Baratheon and Walton who were admired for their military prowess, skillful strategies and courage in winning wars or confronting disastrous events like The Golden Wedding or Maegor's cruelty with all The Hand as a brave leader which inspired others who were willing to follow them through any kinds of tragic challenges.
Prince Aenys and Alyssa were wed in a beautiful ceremony at Tides and all around them feasted and flocked, as they both were largely esteemed. The Targaryens had blessed a happy and fruitful union between the two; Prince Aenys was warm-natured, generous, strong and healthy whilst Alyssa was gentle, attentive and had a sunny disposition. But their joy was short lived when not even one month later, their daughter died in her cradle shortly after birth. Nearby in Valyria, Lord Walton Qarl Corbray of House Velaryon bade his own youngest daughter named Aerea goodbye as she voyageed to Westeros with Lord Darry Hand - Samantha Stokeworth who His Grace had engaged to be his wife’s companion on the journey. Despite the sadness of devastation for Princess Rhaenys’s passing for which Dowager Queen Elinor knew too well the pain of losing an oldest child closest in her heart from deep within her shining tears, something uplifting still bloomed knowing that Oswyck the Drunken Knight kept true faith even up until Prince Aegon’s Golden Wedding to Tarly's Lady Lucinda near King's Landing months later.
She saw her husband's enemies rise up as soon as he died, and they seized him, made him a prisoner and followed after. The reign crumbled and turned to ash five-and-thirty years of age. With her eldest son dead in his cradle shortly after birth, the queen had no choice but to force into marriage Tyanna of the Tower - that same monster who she barely knew. Alyssa endured cruel torture by Tyanna at the funerary pyre until she broke down and agreed to marry him. As sorrow filled all around him Aenys could do nothing but watch his beloved mother succumb to pressure from their enemies outside of Westeros as she gracious bowed out for that same monster as her second son's bride. Little did Aenys know that this event would be just one mere puzzle piece in a long line of events leading to what would later become known as 'The Golden Wedding' – where Targaryens were broken under Maegor the Cruel’s rule by His High Holiness culminating in an arrest warrant served on Queen Regent Alyssa by Lord Rogar Baratheon himself; an arrest warrant ensuring he reigned over Seven with unprecedented control.
Maegor had fallen in with a rough crowd, and Queen Alyssa of House Velaryon had taken him in and granted him a queer kind of courage, which she admired. Maegor was strong not only in boldness but also in his second chances. He befriended Lord Rogar Baratheon and the two were often seen riding all around him or sparring together at House Velaryon’s gates. Despite past feuds and broken relationships, Maegor seemed happier than he had been when he was five-and-thirty years of age. Now almost every night, Rogar could be found seated with Maegor at The Drunken Knight tavern alongside Qarl Corbray from Riverrun and Aerea Targaryen of Dragonstone; drinking ale, singing songs, and battle tales until the early dawn hours.
Another of the King’s Hand's great achievements was arranging a grand wedding between Queen Rhaena Targaryen and the High Septon, as well as in-depth negotiations with the Archon of Tyrosh for Princess Aerea's marriage to Lord Darry. The festivities at Dragonpit included marriage rites, a great tourney amongst knights from all around Westeros, feasts and frolics along Blackwater Bay and finally a spectacular mock sea battle that had everyone cheering. These lavish performances required architecture, decoration and planning that made even the greatest cities look modestly plain. Since it was overseen by the King’s Hand himself and performed in aid of good religion with splendid ceremony, there could be no doubt of its success or beauty; one could only hope its effect on both populace would last beyond this very gathering.
The wedding of Donnel Hightower and Rhaena Targaryen was celebrated with a magnificent gathering in Westeros. Notables such as his High Holiness, Lyman Lannister and Brandon Stark had escorting them their fierce northern bannermen, while from small to great gathered Lords Arryn and Corbray, Royce and Selmy, Dondarrion and Tarly - even the Prince of Dorne, Sealord of Braavos and Archon of Tyrosh along with aling Maegor's men. The feast began at Dragonpit where Rickard Rowan lit the torches of welcome alongside Torgen Oakheart to receive His High Holiness; followed by entertainers perfoming for the mighty-lord. Even Septon Moon gathered some ancient artifacts from all over Westeros which adorned the walls around them adding a sense of splendor!
The wedding guests came ostensibly to celebrate the union between Rogar Baratheon and Dowager Queen Jaehaerys, but underlying their festivities was a desire to take the measure of the true power in the realm - with a young king on the Iron Throne, many wanted to grant audience to those closest to him. Ser Gyles Morrigen, Hand of King Jaehaerys and maester of House Targaryen accompanied by servants led them into the grand hall after a lavish treat in his solar. All around him were magnificently decorated lords, fierce northern bannermen who had gathered for this momentous occasion and small retainers from as far as Oldtown and Casterly Rock escorting their respective ailing lieges. His High Holiness celebrated by granting blessings even amidst numerous enemies present in Westeros. When all was ready, King Jaeaeryys welcomed each guest with great respect, eager to unite them albeit briefly under one roof after so much discord.
Jaehaerys I Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne in the great hall of King's Landing, beckoning to be addressed. He encouraged every Lord in the realm to speak freely and share their counsel as his father once did. It soon became apparent that this was a wise young king who was both soft-spoken and witty, yet shrewd. As he listened intently, laughed at jokes and treated each Lord with equanimity, they took the measure of true power in the realm felt comforted by Jaehaerys' good-humored nature, only growing more cautious when he spoke sternly or grew grim despite his tender fifteen years of age. From Lord Royce to Lord Vance of Wayfarer’s Rest, Rickard Rowan to Kyle Connington, Morton Caron to Jon Mertyns; all found themselves moved whenever Jaehaerys smiled upon them and promised swift justice for loyal service. With Brandon Stark amongst those gathered lords from around The Seven Kingdoms; it seemed even bloodshed between family had not cooled Jaime's hot spirit so recently stoked by his father's Golden Wedding and Targaryens' ascent from Maegor Cruel’s grievous tyranny onto Jaehaerys’s throne.
At Lord Rogar's wedding and tournament, The King's Hand attended and indulged in the activity that was most common in the realm. He hunted, hawked, gambled, feasted, drank and was present but often inattentive; lively yet oft drunken. All around him were familiar faces - Jaehaerys and his Lords Royce, Vance of Wayfarer’s Rest, Rowan, Connington, Caron, Mertyns, Hunterand Oakheart alongside Darryand Brandon Stark. They encouraged each other to speak freely and share stories as Rickard laughed frequently while Kyle was soft-spoken yet witty. Lord Mallisterwas both good-humored yet cautious while Lord Darrywas shrewd having promised many wise words over the years though also stern moments of grim warnings. 
On the wedding night, Lord Rogar, Queen Alyssa and Prince Aenys Targaryen gathered in a secluded room off the great hall at Lys. Tales of what occurred that night are whispered all around - some say it was love at first sight between Lord Rogar and Aenys' young bride; others speak that darkness existed beneath the surface and something sinister lurked in every corner. But whatever may have happened, it is known far and wide as one of most notorious events to have ever occurred on the narrow sea. That same day, Ser Walton Qarl Corbray brought his new wife, Lady Elissa Royce, to join them for a feast fit for the finest royal company - with feasting and drinking oft drunken by many smallfolk who had surrendered Lys to their notorious lords. On this wedding night much laughter rang through the halls as ale was plucked from table’s, numerous sails for she sailed away with her husband on his ship, Silverwing were made & games were played throughout until morning came.
The Hand and King Jaehaerys boisterously roistered around King's Landing in preparation for the wedding of Princess Alysanne and Rhaena Targaryen. Inspired by her magnanimousness, Queen Regent Alyssa saw to it that her chosen guests remain entertained throughout the event—breaking her fast with one group of ladies at Fair Isle, dining with a second at Red Keep and supping with a third along Blackwater Bay. She showed them the wonders of Red Keep, sailed with them around Blackwater Bay and rode about the city such that every highborn resident was able to be part of her Golden Wedding experience. Even amongst these lords and ladies came enemies, particularly those who remembered vividly when Maegor the Cruel burned his uncle Lord Rogar Baratheon alive in Lys or when he plucked out people’s eyes in a sat of violence not far away from where they currently were. Rumors continued to circulate as some pointedly mentioned how those same seven knights had only recently surrendered after sailing on Rhaela’s famous Sea Dragon Tower against Lord Rogar himself, still notorious amongst smallfolk even today. Nonetheless, Queen Alyssa rose to challenge brilliantly leaving each highborn attendee increasingly smitten by her gracious hospitality – thus becoming known as Her Grace's Finest Hour.
Alysanne Targaryen had a slim and slight frame, but was well-known for her beauty. Her shining blue and purple eyes lit up any room she entered, while her honey-colored hair gave her an ethereal glow that captivated all who crossed her path. She was often heard to speak of the wonders she'd seen during the preparations for King Aenys's wedding to Queen Regent Alyssa; from the grandeur of King's Landing, to sailing along Blackwater Bay aboard Prince Rhaena's gaily painted cog Silverwing. Now with the challenge at hand, Princess Alysanne rose to it brilliantly - entertaining those in attendance and showing them all the wonders of Fair Isle by the Sunset Sea where his High Holiness Archon of Tyrosh declared Alysanne’s betrothal . With every stop on their journey across Westeros, Alysanne shone more brightly than ever before as if casting light on all those around her.
Alysanne's wet nurse brought her to the Citadel, where Septon Barth read to her and weaned her off of dribbling on suckling. The powerful forge of knowledge that Alysanne was exposed to created a much different life than when she had been described as a slim, little girl with pretty blue eyes and honey-colored hair who was renowned for beauty by His Grace, King Aenys.
The wedding of Queen Regent Alyssa and Lord Rogar Baratheon was the day Westeros had waited for. The Hill of Rhaenys was a-bustle with caparisoned horses, participants adorned in sparkling jewels, smallfolk cheering bystanders, divided by royal procession banners and greatcloaks draped over antlered Sigils. Grand Maester Benifer's voice ascended as he pronounced them man and wife while cheers erupted from all around the Dragonpit. As they rode towards Westeros in their carriages drawn by steeds, silver streaming behind them like a tale never ending, the faithful cheered. People shouted 'Long live the queen!' and waved flags embroidered with an anltered sigil until their carriage disappeared into the horizon leaving only a faint glimmer on tales of love ascension amidst enemies.
Queen Alyssa and the smallfolk cheered as she ascended the Hill of Rhaenys in her sparkling caparisoned horse to witness her children's arrival. Vermithor and Silverwing, Jaehaerys and Alysanne, descended from the sky before the Dragonpit stirring a cloud of dust that lay heavy over King’s Landing despite its splendor and bright summer day. All around him great leathern wings stirred the air but none were as startling or great as when Queen Alyssa's children brought with them a foreboding of something larger to come. Lord Rogar Baratheon was there amongst many Targaryen loyalists who had been invited by the new queen regent to celebrate this joyous occasion and Walton from House Royce stood among those who watched with admiration at this great Golden Wedding; all of which set face for battles yet to come for Westeros against Maegor's men and various enemies throughout the realm.
Lord Rogar, the strong and distinguished Lord of Storm's End, hosted a grand feast at the Red Keep in King's Landing to celebrate Alyssa’s children’s arrival and to perform the bedding ceremony. As heralded by every Targaryen for generations, it was one of the greatest feasts ever seen as visitors from many far corners of Westeros and even beyond made merry on silk carpets. Vessels of wine decorated with jewels were brought out from cups made of gold while lesser lords from surrounding lands got drunker by the minute. Whatever stirrings had been left behind upon their descending into soil below Dragonpit turned into forgotten splendor amidst the bright light that found its way through every corner of King's Landing that night.
Lord Rogar had hosted and celebrated the ceremony, feast and bedding of the marriage between his nephew, Lord Darry Baratheon to Aerea Royce at Red Keep in King's Landing. After the joyous event, excitement quickly spread throughout Westeros as people heard news of an announcement by His Grace that a tourney was to be held in honor of the great union. Those privileged enough kept their eyes peeled for more information while others made merry over the fact that they could look forward to a thrilling hard-fought tournament. Around this same time, passions ran high with word that another wedding would soon follow for Princess Rhaenys Targaryen of House Oswyck to Drunken Knight Alec Hunter, son of Prince Aenys Hunter.
 Maegor the Cruel, King Jaehaerys, and Alyssa all gathered atop The Wall for a test of arms. It was a thrilling event that brought people from Westeros and beyond to the northern most limits of the realm. As seven knights stepped forward, Valytian named them five old for their loyalty and courageous unquestioned bearing. Among those selected were Walton Qarl Corbray, Lord Darry, Samantha Stokeworth's Hand, His Grace Osceyck Drunken Knight, Alec Hunter and Prince Aenys Targaryen. Maeger declared that he hand-picked each knight himself with no counsel from his advisors and enemies alike sat in awe of his esteemed selection.
King Jaehaerys, declared the second Hand of the King of Westeros, had decreed an attack on enemies who had yielded quick and wise decisions with his own prowess afoot at the tilts that followed Maegor's wedding. After winning the War for the White Cloaks to great fanfare and acclaim, Lady Elissa Royce put forward her five remaining sons as loyal and courageous candidates for His Grace. Joining those two old hands were five designated seven by Queen Alyssa: Prince Aenys Targaryen, Lord Darry, Walton Corbray, Qarl Corbray, and Ser Alyn Silverwing. All unquestioned in their courage in battle, summoned from near and far King's Landing to gather around him; it was this group that truly marked of beginnings of Maegor's reign as maester Lucinda declared it "the Golden Wedding".
The Drunken Knight could be heard boasting of his prowess afoot as he and the Kingsguard journeyed through Flea Bottom. Far behind them, they left the combats they had been competing in, each hoping to be named the victor. The Bard of Flea Bottom mocked him good-naturedly while Tom the Strummer was eager to join in despite his intoxication. But all levity fell away when Ser Willam Stafford unmasked Jonquil Darke, also known as Serpent in Scarlet, famed for her colorful knife fights throughout Westeros and beyond. As every eye in the room widened with surprise it became clear that Daemon Targaryen had not only sent one of his storied knights halfway across Essos but also had a queen regent Alyssa at his side who's quick-thinking had yielded better results than any sagely counsel from King Jaehaerys' lords councillors could have hoped for. 
Ser Lorence Roxton, Ser Victor the Valiant and Ser Willam the Wasp had earned their reputation as madcap knight of valor and were invited to the Reach for a Dubbing ceremony. At Runestone's Academy Hall, these five knights would prove their mettle in various competitions, fight each other and settled by swords. As the cheers echoed through walls of the ancient castle, few questioned this chivalry display until Pate the Woodcock emerged from amongst them with skillful swordsmanship that made him victorious above all others. It was at this moment that King Jaehaerys rewarded him with a knighthood dubbing him 'the lad', winning praises from Targaryens, lords councillors and enemies alike.
Samgood of Sour Hill was no young lad, but the eldest and grizzled knight, scarred and battered by a three-and-sixty campaign. He fought with one eye closed due to his blindness in the left eye while the other continuously searched for any unseen danger. His bald head held a few white strands which flew around as he moved with his toothless mouth wide open in concentration. Nonetheless he remained gaunt, fit from years campaigning around Westeros and quick to notice an enemy’s movement. As Samgood of Sour Hill displayed what honed skillful viciousness over many battles on the field of Reach alongside Ser Lorence Roxton, Ser Victor the valiant, Pate the Woodcock, Ser Joffrey Doggett and others; Ser Willam The Wasp settled any questions about Samgood's valor or chivalry that their madcap adventure may have provoked among them all.
Jaehaerys could barely contain his excitement as he finally got to sit on the Iron Throne. He was determined to wear it like a crown and possess it like a Conciliator. The throne glimmering in white from one end of his sight, brought other tokens of first heritage; Samgood of Sour Hill whom fought and displayed grizzled, scarred, battered traits with three-and-sixty years - one-eyed, bald and toothless; the old gaunt frame quivered with a quickness never witnessed before - viciously honed through an age whose horrors knew no bounds.
The young King Jaehaerys had won the War for the White Cloaks and taken a seat on the Iron Throne. After being crowned, he wended his way to King's Landing for his Golden Wedding with Princess Alysanne, where Lord Rogar had shown up in magnificent fashion. He seemed to have profited from their alliance; as King Jaehaerys was known by many titles - The Conciliator, The Just, The Merciful and so on - yet Lord Rogar had recently been awarded with a lordship because of his loyalty to the Targaryens during the war. His open-handedness and boldness were equally celebrated amongst those who attended the Royal wedding. Although many of Maegor’s men still lingered in King’s Landing, they all bowed before him in respect as if he held some secret favor in court that no one else could possess.
The grandeur of the Golden Wedding was sure to be unlike anything else Westeros had seen before. It seemed almost fateful that such a lavish celebration be held in King’s Landing to prove their glory and magnificence, as it had been ever since Aegon the Conqueror made his daring move on its gates. Prince Aenys Targaryen spared no expense for his nuptials - from bringing merchants from Tyrosh to provide exotic delicacies for the feast, to sending out invites to all corners of Westeros so that even enemies could witness the union between Lord Rogar Baratheon and Princess Alysanne. The seven knights of Jaehaerys’s Kingsguard stood watch over the ceremony, while Queen Regent Alyssa herself presided over proceedings. An extravagance like this had never been seen before in any court at any time in history - which made it all the more fitting when young King Aenys Targaryen said “I do!”  with great joy and fervour.
Queen Regent Alyssa had the privilege and honor of presiding over King Jaehaerys's wedding to Princess Alysanne, along with her siblings, Aerea and Rhaena, who remained un-wed and without issue. The royal nuptials were a lavish affair that proved far-famed, likened as the fateful Golden Wedding between Queen Rhaenys and Lord Oswyck. The festivities spanned several days in Westeros with King’s Hand present all throughout, for it was suitable for the queenly entourage to feel content in presence of all seven knights of Jaehaerys’s Kingsguard who manifested their fitness to serve the manifestly unfit boy king. As gentlemen Sir Walton Corbray, Lord Darry, Qarl Corbray alongside His Grace Samantha Stokeworth attended their lordly betters in audience while Lady Elissa Caron hosted Ladies Alayne Royce and Lucinda Connington amongst others atop at Sea Dragon Tower. With her Lady Rogar Baratheon presiding as esteemed matron-of-honor hosted folk including Kyle Connington across Claws Isle till near morning amidst Her Grace’s prudent stewardship with Rickard Rowan commanding rows upon rows of courtiers from Winterfell north aligned into reverence around Iron Throne less than broke away if mustered needed thereby underpinning Queen Regent’s influence felt all around - irrespective of ale or silverwinged Serpent in Scarlet!
Lord Rogar of the west, who had once been feared and whispered by many to be the one who murdered Queen Alyssa Targaryen, had come to King Jaehaerys's court for a betrothal. Rhaena Targaryen, the young bride was plain yet his uncle saw it fit for him to wed her and beget children when other Lords were manifestly unfit for it since remaining unwed without issue could bring discordant thoughts in a royal family like theirs. On their wedding day not just Lord Rogar's kin but kings from all corners of Westeros as well as enemies outside Oldtown gathered at Silverwing's castle to witness this union thus known as The Golden Wedding. But what seemed dark was that only king Jaehaerys himself and seven knights of his Kingsguard escort them along with Lord Rogar while no members from Queen Regent Alyssa or King’s Hand Accolon’s families were present around them which made everyone fear even more if Maegor's men might have been behind this conspiracy.
Lord Rogar, the soon-to-be husband of Archon's daughter in Tyrosh, had thought himself resolved to his fate until he arrived at the Iron Throne. The colorful and exotic murmurings of distant Essos were harboring an even darker truth: whispers of King Jaehaerys's murdered brother being begot on a plain Essoese maiden had been around for years in Westeros, creating discordant unease for those who knew about it. Despite this looming darkness that seemed to follow him everywhere, Lord Rogar was still taken aback by the charm and comely face of his young bride - her wit and flirtatious demeanor immediately brightening his gloomy state when their eyes met for the first time amidst his old cold seat atop Sea Dragon Tower. His blue-green eyes filled with wonder as he looked upon the Land's most feared family - House Targaryen put forward a new generation of true rulers finding balance through forging powerful political alliances between them and more pressing enemies within Westeros.
Queen Alyssa and Aegon the Uncrowned had been worshipped as monarchs of Westeros during the Battle Beneath the Gods Eye, but they had always opposed one another. Lord Rogar Baratheon had urged them both to accept each other's foreign believes if not for loyalty alone. Nevertheless, Queen Alyssa found it difficult to follow due to her pious belief in the Seven. She even earned her rightful nickname 'queen of charms' for her delightful, flirtatious nature that beguiled all those around her—from old folks like His Grace Dowager Queen Elinor Caron to young men such as Ser Kyle Connington and his uncle Lord Alec Hunter alike. Seeing this queer quality in the queen urged Aegon the Uncrowned on further still in what seemed like a one-sided battle of wits between the two royal figures.
Grand Maester Benifer spoke in favor of Aegon, urging for their commitment to peace and reconciliation. His words were felt the loudest, making a great impression among those present. Queen Alyssa looked briefly at her son Maegor, recognizing his deeply pious and loyal devotion to his foreign gods which she found both delightful and queer yet accepted with grace. He had been worshipping seven deities since they had arrived at Westeros after the Battle Beneath The Gods Eye and was determined to oppose any challengers presented to him by his enemies along the way.
The Queen Regent and King's Hand had gathered many lords of Westeros who seen to suggest marriage between the vast, yet unspoken royalty. Grand Maester Benifer proposed Prentys Tully to Lucinda, Daemon Velaryon to Elinor, Costayne to Maegor and Rogar Baratheon for Jaehaerys. With each suggestion came a word of their piety, fertility and even words of wisdom on behalf of those in favor or against this union. Their loudest speeches proved great in persuading the young king away from any commitment to peace and reconciliation as he saw fit with nomination suggested by his uncle.
The Queen Regent, along with her councillors, had discussed the question of the king's marriage and debated how to reach a decision. Lord Rogar Baratheon was privy to these heated debates and time and time again his wise counsel allowed him to overrule even the most senior among them. The young royal agreed that Queen Alyssa would be an ideal candidate for wedlock, given her piety and fertility – she was still unwed at 25 years old. In addition he suggested Princess Alysanne Targaryen, who was also present in the court hall today. The council members were taken aback by this suggestion but eventually reached consensus when they realised that the King could override their opinions if desired; after-all he was wise beyond his years.
As the various Targaryens grew older, marriage became more of a pressing matter. Queen Alyssa had been persuaded to allow her brother-sister centuries old subject to be disbanded and outlawed in Westeros. But it was expected that Jaehaerys, being two years younger than his elder siblings, would wed once he was old enough: they held close and strong vivid memories from when the councilors discussed how the King's marriage would reach an accord between rival Houses - something that wise beyond his years Jaehaerys had been privy to time and time again; even allowing himself to overrule some opinions given by the Queen Regent on certain occasions. Yet none could have foreseen what was about to happen as Princess Alysanne forcibly persuaded her husband King Aenys that no one should be made to marry if they did not wish it so. This unexpected turn of events disrupted alllord plans when marrying off Aegon, Rhaena or any of their other children just for peace between those same royal allies who had taken up swords against them yet again - provoking outrage with their actions but at least proving themselves loyal brothers and sisters if nothing else.
Septon Mattheus accompanied the High Septon and the King's Landing delegation to Oldtown, in the Reach. The newly appointed and most esteemed High Septon was regarded highly even by the famed Kings of old - Gardener kings who had reigned in splendour and magnificence until they were driven away by Aegon. And while many of their customs had remained long after they were gone, such as marrying siblings to one another, not even Aegon himself could persuade this High Septon to accept it and he had disbanded his court of educated men, outlawing it entirely. However, some whispered that despite his disposition towards this practice that he too held vivid memories growing up close with his elder siblings - two years younger than him - till a certain brother-sister marriage provoked them both enough to take up swords again, something which had been expected from centuries past. 
Septon Moon was a young and inexperienced man, known amongst the smallfolk of Oldtown as the High Lickspittle. The news of his appointment to officiate at the Golden Wedding between High Septon and Father of Faithful had astonished many in King's Landing, who derided him for his lack of knowledge and experience. But on the day of the ceremony he spoke with an unsettling holy authority that silenced those who doubted him. His cautious yet complaisant speech earned him admiration among clergy and faithful alike, while members of both families were pleasantly surprised by how little they their new septon had fumbled. Little did anyone know that this seemingly inconsequential young man would eventually become one of the most famed figures in Seven Kingdoms, regarded even by maegor himself with magnificence.
Septon Mattheus arrived in Oldtown on the Queen Regent's orders. He was accompanied by two of her advisors and also a few other trusted servants, for fear that something grievous might ocurred if he were to fall into the wrong hands. The Septon had been chosen to officiate the much derided Golden Wedding between Lord Rogar Baratheon and his young bride Lucinda, and he could see why there were so many who wanted nothing more than to have him say no when they are so inclined. Nevertheless, the holy man took a cautious yet little complaisant attitude towards it all as he considered it his duty to know little or nothing that may transpire within King's Landing, and with only days spent there since his arrival already enough knowledge seemed to find its way out through whispers.
Rogar Baratheon had to put aside his misgivings when Queen Regent Alyssa thought it desirable for him to marry Princess Alysanne in order to settle the conflict between House Targaryen and House Baratheon. Celebrations for young bride's first flowering were quickly arranged, and on the seventh day of the new year, Rogar married Alysanne at Fair Isle by the Sunset Sea. Despite some apprehension from his uncle, Lord Orryn Baratheon and their enemies from House Tyrell, their union was celebrated like a Golden Wedding with lavish parties all around them. With Jaehaerys as King, Seven Knights of his Kingsguard stood guard and everyone in Westeros rejoiced as they feared no more grievous ocurrances after such a suitable joining of two great houses.
Queen Regent Alyssa, the widow of King Jaehaerys Targaryen and mother to the boy king Aenys, was undeterred by her husband's misgivings on what thought desirable. Swiftly setting aside her own desires, she swiftly agreed to the arrangements set out by Rogar Baratheon at their Golden Wedding procession, including marrying Princess Alysanne Targaryen to his eldest son Orryn. But no one had underestimated Queen Regent Alysa's will and determination; before the plans could be fully executed they were quickly undone by herself as she dispatched Lord Vance of Wayfarer's Rest and Seven Knights of Jaehaerys's Kingsguard on a quest for vengeance against enemieswho had wronged them both in Lys.
Alysanne and Grand Maester Benifer had reached the queen's solar, with Lord Rogar and Daemon Velaryon in tow. They were met by a stern yet prideful servant of the Queen Regent who had underestimated her will and determination. Much to their dismay, they found out that plans long settled and arrangements made had been undone much like before -- all because of her overreaching decision that passed earlier today. Undeterred, they consulted endlessly until an agreement was forged between them all in order to undo the mistakes of its predecessor.
Alysanne Targaryen wept silently and raged against the fates that had thrown her into an arranged marriage with her cousin Jaehaerys. She ran up to the highest tower of Storm’s End, a castle along the Dornish Marches, pleading for something - anything - to be changed. Her tall frame could not shake this sad reality as she watched Lord Rogar Baratheon, one of seven knights of Jaehaerys’s Kingsguard, arrive at the castle gates. It was his decision that ended her overreaching prideful plea, and Alysanne’s grief was felt all around him. Even Daemon Velaryon, Alysanne's servant from Tyrosh and son of Archon of Tyrosh, Pitsoo Prentys Tully reached out to console her. In spite of wild crying and throwing things around in desperation Grand Maester Benifer stayed a step ahead in time to help Alysanne Targaryen reach this unhappy decision before enemies like Alea Silverwing started planning deviousness against Westeros Commoners like herself.
The young king, Jaehaerys, was displeased at the arrangements for his wedding plans to be made on Dragonstone. His Kingsguard stood about him acting as a summing sworn to obey but the recriminations and reproaches continued until the Seven were forced to remember their place and remain silently in their sworn obedience. Soon enough though, Jaehaerys's voice softened and his appeals towards his Hand grew more pleading as he remembered of how deeply Alyssa had wept over her own arranged union when they lived at Lys some years ago. The boy king knew that whilst many across Westeros were repulsed by Maegor the Cruel's unions, it wasn't right for him to rage against his Queen Regent so soon after her tall figure had run to comfort him when elves of Sour Hill threw disparaging comments during Golden Wedding.
The King Jaehaerys and Princess Alysanne mounted their horses and departed the Red Keep for the ancient Targaryen citadel below the Dragonmont. As they rode through darkness, Jaehaerys spoke "Remember our oaths of obedience, speak no ill of those that have done us wrong", a statement made by his young bride which had displeased him shortly before. They were accompanied by newly sworn members of Jonathan Grell's Kingsguard as well as Lord Walon from House Frey, Archon Qarl Corbray from Tyrosh and Aerea Stone, a distant cousin to Lord Darry who now served loyally in The Hand's court at Kings Landing. Their journey was cloaked in secrecy but despite continuous appeals from Westerosi enemies sniffing their passage beneath the walls King'e Landing all gave way to Queen’s Regent’s orders as they ran them under Nine Banner Of Protection to ensure safety too her son and daughter on this fateful day.
King Jaehaerys had instructed his Hand, Lord Oswyck, to accompany him and Princess Alysanne on the journey to Dragonstone. When they arrived at the familiar Targaryen citadel below the Dragonmont, Septon Mattheus tended to them reverently as he knew his duty rightly. As Aenys and Rhaenys ran around the castle gates with joyous laughter echoing through darkness of night, King Jaehaerys spoke solemnly "We must never trust anyone so easily again, for our enemies can be anywhere." The old septon ministered words of wisdom in return, "Your Grace speaks rightly - You must remain vigilant." and he heard them assent before returning back his duties at Dragonstone.
Jaehaerys Targaryen arrived in King's Landing with his wife Alysanne and their retinue, led by Septon Oswyck. They went to Dragonstone shortly after, where Jaehaerys took to wife with a grand ceremony performed in the great yard. While he rightly heard his supplicants and ministered them with justice and compassion, Alysanne was often neglected as she stood there huddled alongside a few of her ladies-in-waiting watching the great white dragon swooping majestically over Dragonstone. Being the benevolent queen that she was, she looked on helplessly at the people she had vowed to protect even if it meant neglecting herself. It seemed her husband had no trust for her due to his old ways of tending to affairs of state. Little did he know that Oswyck had instructed Alysanne throughout everything every step of the way; still he assented although some said it wasn't rightly done.  
Jaehaerys and Alysanne were finally alone in their new home. After being feasted, toasted and the bedding ceremony followed, both were drunk and so they retired for the night, consummating their modest wedding. There was no grandeur from before when his great-great grandfather Aegon The Conqueror took to wife Rhaenys with a hundred lords in attendance around them. But it seemed neither of them had noticed or cared, only looking forward to a bright future together as King and Queen in their own little world one floor away from the busy castle gates of King's Landing.
Lord Rogar, Queen Alyssa, Septon Mattheus and Grand Maester Benifer arrived belatedly in King's Landing in a war galley. What had transpired during their omission from the feast followed by toasts and bedding ceremony that were as drunk yet modest? Rumors of King Jaehaerys and his new queen Alysanne Targaryen who consummated their marriage reached all around Westeros but it proved true when Lord Darry, Hand of The Seven himself alongside Samantha Stokeworth showed up at the castle gates for Golden Wedding. All these events made clear that the Targaryens meant business though the same could not be said about King’s Landing where Prince Aenys's allies were making suspicious moves against his uncle, Aegon the Conqueror.
The castle gates of King's Landing opened to reveal Jaehaerys and Queen Alyssa, with their entourage of Lord Rogar Baratheon, Septon Mattheus, Grand Maester Benifer, and the Targaryins retinue. All taken by surprise at the sudden arrival of the King on horseback and Queen in her palanquin. As tears fell from her eyes onto her cheeks, Queen Alyssa looked back at the galley that had just arrived belatedly - an omission she knew would prove costly yet had no alternative in those bitter moments before. Just as Alysanne shyly held onto one end of his cloak while they wept together - both aware how foolish it made them look but understanding each other's grief- a voice was heard from above said softly "Your Grace..." It was Walther Corbray standing atop a nearby tower as he looked down upon them fondly - mindful enough to prepare for a royal welcome despite what has transpired previously this day.
The Septon Mattheus, who had been called by Queen Alyssa to stand witness before the castle gates as King Jaehaerys and Alysanne wept, stood at attention again when the new king and queen took their thrones. He berated them for their foolish actions and prophesized that the gods would cast a curse upon them for committing such an abomination. With tears in his pious eyes, red from weeping for hours on end, Mattheus denounced the folly of young love in a loud voice swollen with emotion. As he spoke, many of those standing within earshot felt fear descend upon them, realizing they were now living under a tainted rule according to this septon’s pronouncement. Through gritted teeth Lord Walton Qarl Corbray whispered reassuring words to Princess Aerea while Lady Elissa Darry - widow of Aegon's Vassal Hand - embraced Samantha Stokeworth until His Grace was done speaking.
Jaehaerys was honored to have the septon in his kingdom and had paused when Septon Mattheus began speaking. The king said, "Have no fear Septon. I burn with a calm even flame." He had listened intently as the fiery words of the prophetic curse unfolded before him. After he had heard it all, Jaehaerys solemnly declared that he would take Lord Darry from the Dornish Marches to join his advisors at King’s Landing, for surely His Grace should have someone wise enough to alleviate the abomination upon Westeros that was prophesized.
Lord Rogar, an ardent admirer of the king, was asked to take part in the bedding ceremony. Despite his cowed demeanor and blunt manner, he was honored to be a part of it. Septon Mattheus solemnly opened prayers for the bride whilst nobody moved or said a word as flames from invpeccable fireplaces sparked brightly yet everything stayed strangely calm even though fiery emotions seemed palpable that evening. After Lord Rogar spoke in amilder voice than usual, Jaehaerys nodded graciously and thanked him for coming this day - surely doing so not only pleased him but also those around him who looked on at them with respect and admiration.
Lord Rogar smiled slyly as he accompanied the seven knights of Jaehaerys’s Kingsguard down the stairs of Red Keep, to the castle gates. He was escorted by Ser Gyles Morrigen and Sour Sam, along with Pate the Woodcock. As they arrived at the Sea Dragon Tower, Lord Rogar turned to His Grace, asking if he had forgotten his command: "have you forgotten? Separate these children gently if you please". At thiswords, all seven men drew their swords and shouted in unison: "come no closer! Sheath your steel and move aside". The Princess and her brother stood firm, proclaiming that if any were to come closer they would be cut to pieces. Lord Rogar stepped back and nodded proudly at them; "Kill us then", he said. "But know that I will be the first to die." Good - it pleased him that these two Targaryens would not be easily cowed. With a slight bow, Lord Rogar motioned for his escort to continue on their way as he gently ushered the children back into safety.
Queen Alyssa and King Jaehaerys had been married at the Red Keep, the marriage attended by many powerful figures from across the realm, including Lord Rogar Baratheon. With smiling faces they had watched their wedding guests depart – among them seven knights of Jaehaerys's Kingsguard, including Ser Gyles Morrigen, Sour Sam and Pate the Woodcock. Their union was a peaceful one that commanded all to unmake any enmity between them. So too did Queen Alyssa command her husband to part from her with a kiss raised in lifted hands of peace; for she said it was time to send Silverwing - their young bride - home to Fair Isle by the Sunset Sea with her uncle, Ser Merrell Bullock; accompanied by Alysanne Towershield and a retinue of brave warriors drawn from House Velaryon.
The Hand of the Queen Regent watched as King Jaehaerys’s young bride and her entourage prepared their departure from Dragonstone to make their residence at Driftmark. The queen had closed her eyes in shared peace as the newlyweds left, watching them joyfully talking, fishing, hawking, minglingm reading to one another, taking lessons together and even praying beside each other – it seemed an odd contrast with all that had come before – yet now the two were clearly drawn together in those green days of childhood past. As Silverwing flew ever higher and carried them away from Dragonstone the Hand looked down upon a dusty leatherbound book held tightly against their chests; perhaps he sensed what lay ahead for them although he could not had known at that moment all they would accomplish together.
King Jaehaerys and Queen Alysanne were young in love, consummating their marriage soon after they arrived at Dragonstone. They believed strongly in the power of physical intimacy, sleeped naked and shared many long and lingering kisses. The couple often spent late nights talking and joined other lords, ladies, councelors, servants and members of their Kingsguard on fishing trips to Driftmark or hawking journeys over Fair Isle by the Sunset Sea. They truly enjoyed eachothers company while mingling or reading to one another, taking lessons together or praying beside. Even despite all their duties as king and queen later on in their reign, they never forgot the green days of childhood when they flew kites across Silverwing field with people like Lord Rogar Baratheon or Tyanna of the Tower knowing that these memories would cling to them always-even past Jaehaerys’s death some said that he loved recalling those dusty leatherbound tales from Dragonstone with a fond smile till his last breath.
Jaehaerys and Alysanne traveled to Dragonstone to receive counsel from Qarl Corbray and consult with the young King. When they arrived at the Chamber of the Painted Table, they were greeted by Lord Darry, the Hand of the Queen Regent Samantha Stokeworth. His Grace was eager for news on how Princess Rhaenys Targaryen responded to their joining, having believed that sleeping naked and sharing long and lingering kisses had consummated their union. With every step into this strange new place, Jaehaerys found himself in an unfamiliar world being surrounded by unknown faces such as Walton Oswyck from Driftmark or Kyle Connington - Prince Aenys's closest friend - yet he was comforted knowing his beloved Alysanne stood beside him.
Lord Rogar and Septon Mattheus traveled all around Westeros, from King's Landing to Oldtown, on the orders of Jaehaerys and Alysanne. On their journey they bore news of a secret union between higher powers, in hopes that it would brighten the dark days that had befallen Westeros. When they reached Dragonstone - home of House Targaryen - Lord Rogar and Septon Mattheus along with Grand Maester Benifer attempted to send word far and wide to announce the union, but for awhile their plans remained shrouded in secrecy.
Lord Rogar Baratheon had wanted the marriage at Storm's End to remain largely a secret, though he believed it was disrespectful to his family not to announce or dispatch any word of it. Alyn Oswyck and Septon Mattheus, as well as Grand Maester Benifer, attempted to keep the union from being undone in what they deemed an unaccustomed manner. But despite their warnings, determined that Jaehaerys and Alysanne Targaryen’s partaking in a bright wedding be kept hidden due to their enemies who believed such an act would irreparably desecrate the Golden Wedding between his great-uncle Aegon I and Queen Rhaenys held decades earlier on Dragonstone. As such, lords councillors were sent with important documents celebrating the two's union up and down Westeros while Ser Victor The Valiant rode Silverwing furiously towards Sea Dragon Tower where Lord Vance Of Wayfarer’s Rest waited for him with seven knights of Jaehaerys’s Kingsguard ordered by The Hand; these documents included wedding gifts from all around him including Kingfully Charged Horsess From Lord Darry And Samantha Stokeworth, Opals From His Grace The Sealord Of Braavos And Samgood Of Sour Hill Elinor promised by Alec Hunter, Cheeses From Prentys Tully To Enjoy During Their Celebrations At Oldtown To Which Rickard Rowan Contributed Meats And Tom The Strummer Offered Music For All Attending Guests Numbering In Hundreds With Ale And Keg O'Ale Flowing Freely Plies By Drunken Knight As Gifts .
Queen Alyssa had come to Westeros from Dragonstone, and her marriage to Aegon helped set in motion the events of his eventual conquest. She was determined that whatever she wanted should stand, as she did not believe in giving way for unaccustomed blood or chaos. So when Aegon expressed his desire for a wedding between Rogar Baratheon and Princess Alysanne, Queen Alyssa firmly believed it would remain so despite the desperate enemies who sought to undo such an event they found disrespectful. The bloody plan that went on to be known as The Golden Wedding at Storm's End made sure no one could part this union as Queen Alyssa had wanted and believed it should be done.
Benifer and her fellow Kingsguard, Ser Merrell Bullock and Alyn Howard, had been witness to Queen Alyssa's wedding to Aegon in 114 AC as part of Aegon's Conquest. Together they were tasked with facing down the enemies of Westeros at the gates of Dragonstone. Their favoritelovesick valor was on full display that day, until a desperate chaotic retreat was issued by Lord Vance of Wayfarer’s Rest who claimed he had heard rumors regarding Seven Targaryens walking the Red Keep and taking back the Iron Throne. Benifer now stood between Dragonstone and both allies and enemies alike, not knowing what could be done or waiting for them ahead but understanding that whatever it may have been would undoubtedly be bloody.
