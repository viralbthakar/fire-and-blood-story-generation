Jaehaerys I Targaryen, known famously as Aegon the Dragon, asceneded the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms at a young and vigorous age. He went on to rule for many years until his death due to natural causes when he was much older and feeble. Reigning with reverently over the seven kingdoms, Jaehaerys called for more conquests than any ruler before him and often wrote letters in which he spoke in great zeal about unifying all of Westeros under one banner. His most famous was said to be The Tower To Lord Rosby that begins, "My Lords and all my loyal subjects". In it, Jaehaerys proclaimed that no man or woman should stand in his way if they desired a peaceful kingdom based on justice and law-relenting social order.
Jaehaerys I Targaryen had inherited a seven kingdoms ripped and torn by lawlessness, his forefather Aegon the Dragon having conquered Westeros with strength and vigor in his youth. But after ascending the Iron Throne of conquering Jaehaerys was tragically undone by his own easy weakness and indecision, leaving a war-torn kingdom riven by distrust between Aenys and Maegor, both sons of the great Conqueror. Where once Westeros had been united under one law and rule it was now impoverished in spirit, mistreened and mistrustful under divided leadership. The cruelty of Maegor's reign only deepened this divison and Jaehaerys spoke famously that he longed to urgently restore peace to the land whyt he still felt young enough to do something about it before aging into feeble irrelevance as happened with his father upon death from natural causes.
The Battle Beneath the Gods Eye was an epic event between all the pretenders of House Targaryen; Jaehaerys, King Aenys I, Aegon, Rhaena, Aerea and Maegor the Cruel. Jaehaerys intended to unseat his father as ruling monarch with a war waged in gods eye - a perfectly chosen setting for such a dramatic undertaking. However, whilst Jaeaerys managed to stand as wholly surviving from this battle - uncrowned and yet still victorious - it would only add to the already heavily filled pot of mistrust and division which had befallen Westeros since being inherited by Jaehaerys' great grandmother Queen Alysanne. The tumultuous leaderships of both Conquerer and Aenys had plunged Westeros into turmoil, leaving it impoverished, torn apart by lawlessness and riven by weakness and indecision due to countless wars writhed in bloodlust and cruelty. 
The acolytes gathered in the Starry Sept, where Princess Aerea and Queen Rhaena were having a heated discussion. Maegor had left to go back to Gods Eye while Jaehaerys was still weighing his decision on what course of action to take. It seemed that everyone had agreed that staying at the Starry Sept couldn't guarantee their safety and they must leave soon, but not everybody was equally brave in voicing the suggestion. The timid Queen Rhaena began to tear up when it became clear that her plea for them to stay would not be granted. Aerea, however, seemed far bolder and more robust in comparison as she took charge of their situation with resolve despite tears welling from her eyes too. In the end, after much deliberation amongst themselves, all sides conceded and decided it was time for them to go. So packing whatever little necessities they could carry with them, Rhaella and Jaehaerys quickly began leading their group out of the city walls bound for an unknown destination beyond Westeros.
Queen Rhaena had whispered her plans amongst the strongest of Aenys' supporters, looking to overthrow Maegor the Cruel and free the realm from his iron grip. Lord Rogar Baratheon and Nymeria were among those that Queen Alyssa contrived to have put in place, a firstborn twice-widowed who seemed to have more robust spirits than Princess Aerea - timid though she had been - and although Jaehaerys I Targaryen had weighed in selflessly on behalf of his sister, he conceded that Rhaena's suggestion was wiser still. It was decided; they'd go to King's Landing with all haste, setting up campfires between Towers, Darklyn, and Staunton as their numbers grew ever more each night before finally arriving at Fair Isle just off the coast. Now it was time for them to march forth into King's Landing itself if they were going to stand any chance at putting an end Maegor the Cruel’s reign.
Prince Jaehaerys ascended the Iron Throne and, determined to put his strongest efforts in righting the wrongs of Maegor's tyrannical rule, he insisted all decisions be made in his name. However, while everyone at King's Landing wished only justice and freedom from tyranny within the realm, behind closed doors whispers could be heard among many lords - were these contrived rules arranged by Dowager Queen Alyssa and Lord Rogar Baratheon? Who knows what else they had planned on Fair Isle that no one ever dared speak of?
The funeral of Maegor I Targaryen was held in King's Landing with Lords Rosby, Towers, Stokeworth, Massey, Harte, Bywater, Darklyn Rollingford, Mallery and Bar Emmon of the Crownlands accompanied by Byrch and Staunton Buckwell watching as the young Mortal marched to his pyre. His death had determined that Prince Jaehaerys would ascend the Iron Throne and all decisions made in his name were insisted upon by Dowager Queen Alyssa with Lord Rogar offering backing. But no one foresaw what chaos would ensue once Maegor was declared dead.
Maegor I Targaryen had just been laid to rest with a mortal, young body on the funeral pyre outside King's Landing when Prince Jaehaerys and Rhaena Targaryen got word. They quickly took ship for Pentos in order to flee their father’s wrath, with Lord Rosby and Ser Jon Tollet of Towers leading the way. Bywater, Darklyn, Rollingford and Mallery had bent their knees and laid their swords at his feet when Maegor slid from the back of Vermithor and hailed them all as leal. He then proceeded to drink deeply from Bar Emmon wine before Buckwell announced that they should climb aboard the Red Keep vessel at port and make way for Pentos as his cousin Prince Jaehaerys commanded.
Prince Jaehaerys, along with his son Aegon and three Kings' Justices, Lord Confessor, Chief Gaoler and the Commander of the City Watch marched to Gods Eye, putting in chains those who had helped slay Maegor the Cruel and calling for their immediate execution. Four knights of the Kingsguard followed closely behind them as they joined a large group of prisoners in black cells late that night. All across Westeros their coming was met by cheers as all bent their knees and laid their swords at his feet, hailing him - leal - as rightful King Maegor's heir.
Lord Rogar Baratheon, Queen Alyssa and Maegor Targaryen arrived at King's Landing with the intent of usurping the Iron Throne. As they seized control, those who had aided in their cause found themselves accused of abetting a traitor. The highborn and the lowborn alike were arrested and imprisoned for attending events that would ultimately lead towards Maegor's rise to power. Many of their former allies from Gods Eye were also put in chains or called for execution, including Prince Jaehaerys, Aegon and three knights of the Kingsguard who had come late to help slay. They were subsequently joined by Lord Confessor, Chief Gaoler and Commander of the City Watch in black cells beneath King's Landing.
Maegor and Queen Alyssa had just arrived in King's Landing, seizing control of the Iron Throne with Lord Rogar Baratheon aiding them. Maegor had accused both highborn and lowborn alike for abetting his usurpation, leading to many being arrested or imprisoned as a result. Now, however, he faced a new challenge in the form of Dowager Queen--the widow of late King Jaehaerys Targaryen. She urged him to listen to them now but Maegor was full of silently fury at her refusal to yield power. He had her tortured and slain right in the Red Keep without much thought given to it. When word spread across Westeros about what he'd done, many lords stared nervously around their campfires wondering who would be next on Maegor's list.
Lord Rogar Baratheon stood before the High Septon, awaiting judgement for his actions. His eyes were stern and unyielding as he was accused of helping Maegor the Cruel torture and slay innocent people throughout the Kingdom and its strongholds. He agreed to plead guilty, but pointed out that in this case drastic measures needed to be taken to march on against those who had wronged them - they needed to winkle out all those responsible and put them to death; while also tendering hostages as insurance so as to ensure their surrender without further bloodshed between loyalists. However, these latter points fell upon deaf ears with the Dowager Queen urging "Do you listen to them now? Are we here so full silently?".  As tensions rose in the throne room, Maegor stepped forward claiming that he may have come up with a solution that satisfies both sides: Those found guilty of their worst crimes will be executed along with a few other Knights of theirs held as hostages by Lord Rowan whose loyalty cannot ever be questioned. All agreed on Maegors declaration and soon afterwards began preparations for a bloody march across Westeros led by none other than Lord Rogar Baratheon himself!
Lord Rogar climbed the Iron Throne and summoned all his lords to his side. Maegor, who had previously stood for trial for executing prisoners, agreed with him as he pointed out that it was time to march in order to winkle out traitors, do away their own worst loyalists and put them to death. Only then could some of them be offered as tender hostages in order to ensure the other's surrender without any further bloody consequences. Maester and Knights meekly followed Lord Rogar's orders, accompanied by a comely young Jaehaerys Targaryen and Queen Alyssa Baratheon wherever they went as they all announced that blood had been shed but it was now time for reconciliation between formerly opposing forces.
Jaehaerys stood tall from his seat on the Iron Throne and made a loud pronouncement that he would overrule the wishes of the assembled Lords Baratheon, Velaryon, and other great lords. The proud prince had made a display of strength for all to see as he sat upon the ancient steps below him and gave them a single dare to follow him or be left behind. A cheer went throughout the room as Jaherys defied convention with a young confidence that could only be seen in one who held such a lofty position.
Queen Alyssa was loath to go against her son's wishes, despite Lord Rogar pleading for the Queen Regent's understanding. In the Iron Throne room, she had displayed a strength of will rarely seen in Westeros; although Jaehaerys and his Lords Baratheon followed her pronouncement to overrule Maegor, they did so reluctantly and with great trepidation. When it was announced that Maegor was to be spared from such dire consequences, an uproar could be heard even beyond the city walls. Prince Rhaena had dared to cheer in joy but quickly sat back down as Jaehaerys gave her an icy glare of warning. The Queen seemed contented by the desired result; whilst all around her rested uneasily at this newly made choice.
Maegor, along with a contingent of lords, knights and his loyal acolytes, escorted Queen Alyssa and Lord Rogar to the throne room of King's Landing. There he bade them publicly renounced their allegiance to him, do homage to his nephew Jaehaerys and purchase their pardons with gold. Those who complied were granted amnesty and those who refused were required to surrender hostages or be executed. The lords from distant Towers, Darklyn, and Staunton renewed their vows of loyalty at once while being loath that they had gone against her son's wishes but was spared in the end.
Maegor's unforgiving reign extended even to Tyanna of the Tower, who was judged guilty for daring to raise a hand against Prince Viserys and Queen Alyssa. The royal clemency required her to surrender heads of all those associated with her deed, else face torture and death. With dread in his heart, Ser Jon Tollett escorted Maegor's men through the Tower as they gathered up prisoners. One by one they were dragged before Maegor, who with a pronounced royal authority adjudged each innocent or guilty and demanded that those found guilty submit their heads or be taken away never to be seen again. The scene was an eerie reminder of Maegor’s earlier conquest when he bade Lords Rosby renounce allegiance to him, bade them do homage to his nephew Jaehaerys and send a son/ daughter from their family to court serve king and stand as hostages - all if they wished for pardons granted in exchange for gold after emptying the dungeons of King’s Landing.
Ser Maladon Moore and Ceryse Hightower held Tyanna of the Tower, who struggled to slip away from their grasp as they took her to King Maegor in Westeros. When Ser Owen Bush insisted on delivering her himself, she admitted that it was a fabrication and broke into loud fits of shrewishness. Maegor responded with finality: he had already witnessed the slaying of his four Kingsguard members – a crime for which Tyanna had been adjudged guilty even before she dared raise her head - and his royal clemency only extended so far. With these words, he pronounced that Tyanna's guilt could not be denied, and her heads would soon be delivered as promised.
Maegor had refused clemency and sentenced Ser Olyver Bracken, Ser Raymund Mallery, Ser Jon Tollett, Ser Symond Crayne, and even his own Kingsguard member, Ser Donnel Hightower to death for their plot against him. As the fall of Maegor's kingdom was proclaimed in Westeros, only a few survived to carry tales from it. Maegor's loyal companion Lord Rogar Baratheon had turned on the Mad King at the urging of a mysterious comely young woman who had arrived with mysterious fabrications about House Targaryen's power. He played a late move in accepting her wiliness but courageously departed the Iron Throne after a shrewishness witnesseyd by six Lords Oakheart from The Wall. With one stroke he slew his enemy and urged that justice be served upon those who dared disobey him.
Ser Harrold Langward demanded that Lord Rosby and the other Lords of the Crownlands accede to Jaehaerys's Trial by Battle, offering that if Maegor were victorious he would be proclaimed innocent. Ser Olyver Bracken and Ser Raymund Mallery quickly agreed, but Jon Tollett urged some sort of clemency for Maegor, despite his crimes. When Ser Symond Crayne refused to accept any punishment short of death, Ser Donnel Hightower was eager to accept the King's offer--causing a rift among this group of wise men. When it seemed certain that no resolution could be found amongst them, Damon the Devout stepped forth from amongst Lord Rogar Baratheon's company knights and into the tent. He made short work of Ser Gyles Morrigen in five quick exchanges and thus accepted the offered Trial by Battle on behalf of Maegor--urging a swift end to proceedings with little regard for himself or protecting Maegor any longer than necessary.
King Maegor had just dismissed Ser Harrold Langward, Jaehaerys, and the fourty other would-be challengers of his right to rule. The swift trial by battle had left many uneasy in King's Landing. To appease the people, Queen Alyssa and Grand Maester Benifer encouraged the spread of prince's clemency - with dissidents swearing fealty or returning from exile in Pentos. Lord Rogar Baratheon was one such person who won over by fair-spoken, open-handed and chivalrous behavior that swiftly earned him acclaim as a learned and pious lord amongst them. But Queen Alyssa was still unconvinced given her late husband's claims that Rogar was weak and feckless. Reluctantly she gave him leave to make for Highgarden across the Crownlands on his private tour of Westeros for now which he eagerly did with Lord Rosby at his side along with a few acolytes from Tyanna of the Tower Dreamfyre Tower - none knowing what fate awaited them ahead! 
At the height of King Maegor's power, Westeros and the realms sworn to House Targaryen reconcieled on account of his great strength. Men like Silas and Dennis the Lame were ready to exterminate all those who did not agree with them but the King had set his mind according on bringing unity back to the realm. He went from one castle to another, collecting oaths of fealty until he arrived at Golden Tooth where Lady Lucinda convinced him that some kind of reconciliation was possible if he listened. The King remained at Golden Tooth for several days while Ser Joffrey Doggett sheltered, fed and gave supplies to him as part of their connivance. Meanwhile, other loyal lords moved around Westeros in support of King Maegor, recruiting acolytes and Knights alongside them while they vanquished any remaining threats against him or House Targaryen. Despite his exotic behaviour that scared many people, those who knew him better praised his pious foundation which ultimately won over a good number who supported him until news came that Grand Maester Benifer had called weak and feckless Jaehaerys a fair-spoken man openhand chivalrous and courageous thereby making others see reason for return from exile in Pentos before everyone dismissed Jaehaerys' learning or piety as an act doomed to failur.
For two weeks, Septon Moon and his men had been camped outside of Oldtown. They were led by Lord Oakheart and Lord Rowan, who proclaimed that they had been blessed by the gods on their quest to vanquish the vanity of House Targaryen. Lady Lucinda boasted that King Maegor himself was supporting them with his connivance, however Chief Gaoler Silas questioned this. When Septon Moon took some time to be alone with his thoughts, he read and write about a prophecy that had been blessed upon him with thunderous breath from an imposing angel – one he believed would lead them to reconciliation between the kingship and house targaryen.
Septon Moon lay barefoot and in a beard of immense fervor, his pronunciation of the sinfulness of these men renowned throughout Westeros. As he proclaimed from high above Lord Oakheart's campground, all who listened knew this was a foolishness born out of barren boredom--none more so than Lord Rowan, whose questioning look read louder than the thunderous proclamation itself. Despite being blessed by the septon himself that morning, Lord Oakheart refused to offer recompense for such an imposition—much to Septon Moon’s chagrin as each syllable escaped his mouth with a carved intensity. The rabble had been bestowing their own blessing upon him since arriving at Darklyn and Staunton where he had been invited to speak, but it was far from what he had hoped for. To receive stern refusal on such a day felt like sacrilege; Pentos be damned if God wouldn't even offer one man comfort in these times.
Septon Moon had just finished speaking to House Targaryen, citing his pious beliefs and earned reputation as the renowned Septon of Oldtown. Lord Hightower, His High Holiness, and Lords Oakheart and Rowan refused to allow him entrance into Starry Sept, much to his fervor. Denounce by Lord Donnel the Delayer for being foolish enough to have come so far barefoot and bearded out of an immense but sinful eagerness, he offered up entreaties they had repeated turned down with real reluctance. As House Baratheon set forth in closed curtains on their way to Crownlands, Lickspittle scurried after them, hoping that perhaps if he followed quickly enough, one day his loyalty would be bestowed upon those who lay truly wise at the feet of The Wall and in the Seven Kingdoms.
King Maegor, the Queen Regent, High Septon Lord Rogar and their Lickspittle had finally made it back to Oldtown with the anointing of King Jaehaerys under way. As they arrived, they soon learned that Jaehaerys' persuasive words had persuaded Septon Moon's followers to disperse throughout Westeros as promised. However, despite previous denunciations by his strange and zealous cult, Moon himself still refused to desist. He had preached anew and sinned anew against his vows; the long conflict between House Targaryen and his ragged horde was still alive. In light of this rebellion, King Maegor ordered a search for any remaining disciples within Oldtown’s borders in hopes of finally bringing peace to Westeros once and for all. Outside the city walls, poor fellows from Fair Isle gathered around campfires telling tales about Queen Alyssa’s wise rule and tireless endeavours for justice; this only served as further reminder of what would be at stake if Jaehaerys' rule failed.
Jaehaerys and his party had arrived in King’s Landing, travelling through the Reach towards what would become known as the Field of Fire. Now the task at hand was to deal with a dangerous situation - Lord Rogar had gathered a ragged horde of Moon's followers to proclaim him king. Having already considered sending an envoy to forbid it, Jaehaerys instead chose to lead his own troops against them, pitting two kings on the field of fire and hoping that would be enough to disperse them. With some reluctance Rhaena, Alysanne and Queen Alyssa agreed- there seemed no better way without causing such slaughter. Meanwhile, down in Dorne Rhaenys Targaryen wanted nothing more than for her brother Maegor's rule over Westeros to end but little did she foresee that this could potentially put Jaehaerys on both sides of a long conflict if he persisted in having anointing completed without first persuading Septon Moon's followers to disperse.
The conversation in the king's council had become heated, with everyone arguing their point, each convinced they were right. Jaehaerys looked on with some reluctance as he listened to them all. Suddenly the door opened and in strode a strapping man unshorn and comely by his arm - Septon Moon followed by Poor Fellows from Oldtown who immediately began preaching at all present. Before long, the dispute was resolved in a most unexpected way: The council admitted that Septon Moon had a better way of leading and the Poor Fellows agreed to disperse until required again. Everyone retired for the night considering what had just happened, pitting King against Council for forbid such slaughter when there must be a best way forward like as not.
Septon Moon and the comely young woman had found refuge in a small, poorly lit tent; laughter could be heard inside as the hours passed. However, what followed was unexpected: there was a groan of pleasure, a woman's shriek and then an angry bellow that echoed through the camp. Suddenly the entrance to the tent was thrown open and out burst the woman, half naked and barefoot with Septon Moon right behind her holding what appeared to be a leaking flagon of wine which he quickly dropped when he saw they were not alone. It was clear from his drenched clothes and wide eyes that he had been passing some short time before in occasional gusts of laughter until it suddenly turned into terror as his companion had scampered away unshorn and terrified. He seemed unaware that most of his body was dripping red with blood, for somewhere in his struggle to follow her out quickly he had been slit open down one side.
Septon Moon staggered out of the tent, lurching after the doxy who had vanished into the night. His acolytes and his Poor Fellows pressed in pursuit, knocking over tents while they searched for her. Dozens of women were seized and any man who resisted was beaten mercilessly, but the hunt came up empty. Half of camp was turned upside down before weariness finally brought them to a halt - though some swore they saw a Pale Shadow at times amongst their numbers, lending great strength to their efforts. When all seemed lost, Septon Moon collapsed and died; apparently devoured by his own rage – leaving only charred campfires, torn tents and  vent streams of blood still dripping where he had been standing behind him.
The four Poor Fellows had remained after Lord Rosby's pursuit of Septon Moon failed and the others had vanished into the night. The guards brought a flagon of wine to their tent, laced with something to recall them back from the trance-like state they'd found themselves in when half the camp collapsed and died around them. As sun came up, all four were sharing the strange brew from a single flagon while they unpacked their belongings that had been knocked over during their angry pursuit of Moon. But before noon could arrive, they suddenly crumpled face down where they stood, dead before anyone could even question what--or whom--they'd shared with.
As the news of Moon's death and King Maegor's ascension reached Oldtown, a flood of ragged, tearful acolytes led by Lord Rosby slipped away from the red-stone Sept. The High Septon solemnly recalled how Moon had remained in his tent and shared touched with laced flagon of wine with four Poor Fellows as the sun was coming up on the morning when the Wiser men claimed him for life - only to find all four dead before noon. Now there was nothing to be done but for Ser Jon Tollett and Lady Lucinda to carry away his corpse and lay it upon its own bed back in Moon's camp. As Westeros waited for Maegor Targaryen, who would become as cruel if not more than his father Maegor I, some wondered if there would ever be another septon like Moon again.
When news of King Maegor's death reached Oldtown, a septon Moon and his men seized upon the opportunity to lay claim to the throne. Lords Rowan and Oakheart quickly came forward to vie for the crown, much to Moon's disapproval. Fighting breaking out amongst their respective followers, Lord Rowan made one final attempt at diplomacy when he turned to the two lords, suggesting they commit their knights and men-at-arms to an assault on the walls of Oldtown. Though neither were keen this idea given their reluctance towards bloodshed, for a moment it looked as though peace might yet prevail in Westeros.
Rob the Starvling and Lorcas the Learned had come forward to claim possession of Moon's mortal remains, boasting that they had seen seven-pointed stars strapped naked, bloody, and rotting onto his chest. They claimed the moon was certain to have been an acolyte of their order. Lord Rowan Oakheart stepped forward to confront them as fights continued breaking out between Moon's men and Lords Rowan’s own followers. But before a clear victor could be declared Rob and Lorcas became suddenly silent as all eyes fell upon a comely young woman marching through the campfires with four knights of the Kingsguard at her side. She announced herself as Princess Aerea - oldest daughter of King Aenys I Targaryen who had recently passed away in Pentos and said she has come to reclaim her father’s mantle with Lord Oakheart by her side; ready to commit their knights and men-at-arms towards an assault on the walls of Oldtown if needed despite some reluctance from among Lords Rosby, Red Dog of the Hills, Ser Jon Tollett, Staunton Godwyn, Maegor Targaryen, and more.
"Ah!" exclaimed Lorcas the Learned as he joined Lord Hightower atop the city walls, interlocking arms with him just in time to watch a mass of brave knights ride forth. The attack had been sudden and unexpected, most of them getting drenched in rain and set afire within a hundred yards of reaching the Starry Sept. Fewer than a hundred remained; but they were boldest and bravest knights in all Westeros - or so they boasted anyway. In moments, Lord Hightower had reached for his sword and was removing the seven-pointed star from his buckler - presented it proudly to Lorcas as if claiming victory even before their enemies had arrived at Oldtown's gates. As predicted by Moon, Rob the Starvling and Lorcas himself only days ago, this glorious group now marched on possession of Moon's Mortal Remains which were already strapped to Rob's back - naked yet seemingly unharmed despite being bloody and rotting.
Septon Moon stood amid the chaos of the abortive attack, leading a small party that included Lord Rowan, Lord Oakheart and Sir Donnel. The scene before him was one of looting and pillaging; no mercy had been given to those who had not followed Septon Moon's orders to decamp at once. Once they had streamed away in the night, their attackers laid waste to Oldtown even more ferociously than they had set afire its city walls. While fewer than a hundred men rode forth with Lorcas the Learned and Lord Hightower, most of them died within a hundred yards of leaving camp as their boldest knights were removed from battle one by one. As Septon Moon presented himself before his attackers he could already see that victory would be futile for these courageous few - but too late to turn back now.
Jaehaerys Targaryen and the woman who had followed him from King's Landing to Braavos finally arrived in the city. There, they came face to face with Rogar Baratheon, Lord Confessor of the Queen Regent and leader of the Faceless Men. In a desperate attempt to control Jaehaerys, Rogar ordered his acolytes to murder Septon Moon - an act which failed when Moon managed to melt away into the night like a sinful wraith. Seeing Moon's disappearance as their sign to send across a message, Lord Rowan and Sir Donnel decamped Oldtown and streamed away towards Crownlands before slaughtering any who stood in their way against looting and pillaging. Despite this abortive attack on Jaehaerys' rule, Tree Towers remained loyal still, it seemed that nothing could cut through his determination - not even attempts at having he or his followers sent off into disappearance by none other than Maegor The Cruel himself.
Wiser men had already given Maegor of House Targaryen and Prince Jaehaerys their leave, yet it was only when Lord Rowan, Lord Oakheart and the Faceless Men left Oldtown that the attempted murder of Septon Moon had been taken seriously. By then the murderers were long gone, having melted away into Braavos after Moon's disappearance. Seeing no other course of action to send a message to those who might try to commit such a sinful act in future, Lord Rowan decided to take justice into his own hands - bending all laws of natural alacrity with obedient penitence.
Prince Jaehaerys' coronation at the Starry Sept of Oldtown was clear, safe, and anointed with great joy. Thousands had gathered to witness a new era for Westeros; Ser Gyles Morrigen, Grand Maester Benifer, and Ser Joffrey Doggett were amongst those sworn in loyalty to the King. Jaehaerys then set off from Riverrun accompanied by Rhaena, Alysanne, Aerea, Rhaella and his newly appointed Queensguard lead by Lord Rogar Baratheon. All pledged their allegiance to him as they watched his waning forces march confidently along The Crownlands back towards King's Landing.
 Grand Maester Benifer had called for a meeting between the boy king Jaehaerys and outlaw knight Ser Joffrey Doggett at the Iron Throne. He urged Jaehaerys to undo his uncle's decrees such as rescinding bounties for Warrior’s Sons and Poor Fellows and offering Ser Joffrey a place at his side in the Kingsguard, but King Maegor refused. Before leaving, Ser Joffrey laid his longsword at the feet of Lady Lucinda who had been appointed Queen Regent until Jaehaerys came of age by Red Dog Of The Hills as he waged war against people who rose against him and desired to no longer tolerate treason or rebellion.
King Rhaena and her sisters, Dreamfyre and Lady Lucinda, had departed from King’s Landing on the coronation day to travel afar. With a force of lords accompanying them, they arrived at Oldtown surrounded by grandeur. Lord Farman granted them his hospitality with utmost respect as Princess Alysanne remained in Highgarden to stay on behalf of their father Aenys who was supposed to mount the Iron Throne if it wasn't for his passing away due to illness. Meanwhile, King Maegor the Cruel declared war against people across Westeros who rose against rule of House Targaryen while Jaehaerys Targaryen stayed committed in Kingsguard urging King Maegor's wars be murmured and he return back from games he waged reluctantly which upset Red Dog of the Hills along with others.
Queen Rhaena had finally been coronated queen in Oldtown after departing from King's Landing. Accompanying her on the journey was Rhaella, Aerea and Grand Maester Benifer who all stayed at Highgarden during the coronation festivities. What befell them all upon their return to King's Landing was something that none of their party could have ever observed were they to remain in the rural areas of Westeros they had originally departed from. As it been said, Lord Farman gave a grand gift to Princess Alysanne given his curiosity as he wrote in a bold and willful manner unlike other lords who were shy, timid and frightened by this sudden change in power yet terrified to speak against it.
Queen Rhaena, Aerea and Grand Maester Benifer had observed the coronation of Rhaella with a sense of awe. But it was only the beginning of the events that befell Westeros in the reigns of Maegor and Jaehaerys Targaryen. Upon hearing news of Maegor's fall and Jaehaerys' ascension to King's Landing, Queen Rhaena accompanied by Queen Alyssa and Princess Aerea returned to Oldtown for his official coronation. The devoted crowd cheered at their arrival; required as part of Jaehaerys' coronation process. For being such a young King, he was believed to be wise beyond his years - lively, quick-witted, bold yet adventurous enough to question the status quo. Few could have imagined this child-king would one day become known as The Conquerer, sire 17 children and unite all seven kingdoms.
King Jaehaerys' triumphant return to King's Landing was felt far and wide. Hailed by an enormous crowd, Maester Benifer could feel the people's joy as it reverberated throughout the city walls. At the front of the procession were several Poor Fellows - gaunt and unwashed, but loyal to a fault - who begged for clemency which Jaehaerys had promised Ser Joffrey he would grant. Upon arrival at Oldtown, The Grand Maester quickly reconciled with Lord Rowan, Bar Emmon and other members of Court. On his throne in the Great Hall, Jaehaerys' quick-witted and adventurous nature shone through as he sworn a confession from Rob the Starvling that reignited years old feud within House Targaryen.
