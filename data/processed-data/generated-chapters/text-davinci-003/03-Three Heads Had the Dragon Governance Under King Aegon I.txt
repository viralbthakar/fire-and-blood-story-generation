Aegon I Targaryen was renowned for forging something greater than himself. He cooled six realms of deadly fire with his sword made from steel, he rode a dragon that had terrorized Westeros for centuries, and on the Iron Throne of Westeros he sat. The significance of his legacy stretched to the far ends of the realm, and his accomplishments are still remembered as one of the greatest in history.
Aegon I was determined to bring former enemies into the fold in order to reconcile the Seven Kingdoms to Targaryen rule. He made great efforts and travelled far across Westeros, urging people at every corner of the realm, from Duskendale and Gulltown to Evenfall Hall and Tarth, to serve him. His famed courage shown through fire and steel had cemented his renown even before he sat on the Iron Throne with Rhaenys by his side. As people witnessed his greatness first-hand, many were encouraged by Good Queen Alysanne's leal pardons or King Jaehaerys' conquests during The Great Council of Harrenhal, so much so that Aegon received gifts from all across - from a Redwyne girl sending Aegonfort's stones for building-up Dragonstone castle, or a bastard born man gifting Visenya's Hill for turning it into a royal residence - as a token of their former loyalties soon turned loyalty to House Targaryen.
Aegon and his sisters Visenya and Rhaenys brokering matches across the Seven Kingdoms to ensure their rule was secure. Aegon took a special delight in sealing these matches as it ensured loyalty from each of the seven kingdoms. Notable matches made included the double wedding between House Blackwood and House Bracken, as well as another one, involving Lord Ronnel Arryn of The Eyrie with a Redwyne girl, at The Arbor. Torrhen Stark of Winterfell married an Evenstar of Tarth in a lavish ceremony at White Harbor for all rivaled to see. Queen Visenya then arranged for marriages between noble families far and wide; from Lannisport to Casterly Rock to Tarth, House Corbray, Hightower and Harlaw were all sealed by alliance through betrothals brokered by her own hands. In addition, a Rowan girl was found with child by a scullion shortly after this flurry of marriage was arranged; she had been taken into fosterling by Orys Baratheon's house but she would remain forever aloof from her betrothed due to the bastard she bore.
The good Queen Alysanne had long exercised soft reign from King's Landing, traveling far and wide to all the seven kingdoms in order to understand their customs. In particular, the actions of Aegon and his sister queens Rhaenys and Visenya were widely doubted by common folk across the realm as their weddings with prominent houses took too much delight for them. A special double wedding was arranged between House Blackwood and Bracken; then a match between a Redwyne girl and Lord Edmyn Tully was sealed – matched by Evenstar of Tarth to House Corbray while Torrhen Stark married into House Hightower - though these affairs were easily overshadowed when it transpired that Rowan girl had been found with child by a mere scullion at Casterly Rock. With much secrecy required, Grand Maester Gawen ensured that tiny bastard fosterling was taken care of away from noble eyes at White Harbor before being sent for adoption to distant relatives at The Arbor.
During Aegon's reign, the designated seat of power was moved from Dragonstone to a more comfortable and safe location. King’s Landing had much historical importance since it was close to his conquest in the War for Seven Kingdoms one. Aegon had several castles built surrounding this area, such as "Aegonfort" between King's Landing and Dragonmont, which he spent much time installing himself and had to be ten times reinforced with its walls lined with salt. As part of his love for royal customs, he even changed its name from Smoky Castle to "Aegonfort." In addition, nearly all the resources were spent on constructing a castle at Dragonstone. An enormous smoky tower known as Dragonmont now stands tall there where Aegon Targaryen once ruled over Westeros with Rhaenys and Visenya by his side before reluctantly being doubted by some of his own people.
Aegon devoted his reign to an endless royal progress, taking his court from one castle to another and guesting with each of his great lords in turn. His first stop was Gulltown, where he had the support of Lord Orys Baratheon, who was Good Queen Alysanne's designated heir when her eldest brother died. From there soon followed visits to The Eyrie, Harrenhal and Riverrun before ending at Lannisport. Meanwhile visits were also made to Casterly Rock and Crakehall as well as Old Oak and Highgarden. When even more time was spent at Oldtown than anywhere else except King's Landing it seemed like all Aegon's love lay here in this ancient historical city surrounded by salt flats and smoky brimstone!
Aegon's glittering court, attended by devoted knights in silk and steel, traveled from Gulltown to The Eyrie all the way to Harrenhal and Riverrun then, Lannisport and Casterly Rock before continuing to Crakehall and Old Oak arriving at Highgarden. Everywhere he went his people were instilling with power; Aegon wanted none of the rebellions that had put many of his predecessors on the Iron Throne. During this endless royal progress he was determined to forestall any further disturbance by visiting even the far ends of The Realm and taking court in every castle his great lords owned. Thus, Smallfolk across Westeros saw their beloved king as he journeyed across seven kingdoms one after another making sure folks understood that no matter how far they lived they still held a place in Aegon's loving heart.
King Aegon and his brother, Aenys, traveled across the seven kingdoms in a royal progress of feasts and balls and hunts and hawking. Everywhere they went, the people gathered to behold the great splendor of their royal visitors, gracing them with generous hospitality. The smallfolk put on glittering show for their illustrious guests while knights attired in vibrant silks and steel attended them wherever they went. Though he never expected rebellion to appear on this solemn journey, Aegon still instilled it into all who saw him: he needed them to understand who held the power here. His presence was enough to forestall any attempted dissent as they made their way from castle to farmer's field; each new place learning just how much greatness could be contained within two Targaryen brothers
King Aegon had conquered and allowed many kingdoms to continue their existing laws, both great and small. He confirmed the rights of many of the prior lords and kings, retained or acquired new castles, and was ever generous towards those who bent the knee. On his royal progress he traveled far and wide, holding court in rather humble dwellings such as a farmer's field instead of sumptuous palaces - where he made note of their hospitality amid the splendor. Even a mere man who beheld King Aegon was impressed by his great power and kindness that allowed so much to remain unchanged despite having been conquered.
King Aegon had successfully conquered Westeros through the Conquest and established his rule across seven kingdoms one. As expected, he then set about fighting to settle existing rivalries between places like Evenfall Hall and Tarth, adjudicating new disputes between the bastion born King Jaehaerys the Conciliator and a Redwyne girl from Gulltown. With decrees from Harrenhal down to Sisterton, he allowed small lords great leeway in their local affairs, confirming their rights that had been retained even before Aegon's grand victory. He goes as far as allowing each chief local lord over petty matters such as common justice within their lands, but ultimately sovereign authority was vested in him alone.
When King Aegon the Dragon proclaimed Westeros to be his own, he began to take steps to regularizing the exact borders which he and his descendants would rule over. He affirmed this in a court held at Visenya's Hill, anointed by holy septons and godly maesters alike, with all of the major lords and banners of Westeros present. With them he decreed that every corner of the realm was now under Targaryen rule; from Evenfall Hall in the far ends of the realm, to Tarth on one end, Gulltown on another, down towards Storm's End and up past The Eyrie until Seven Kingdoms were ruled as one.
King Aegon had proclaimed his conquest of the Seven Kingdoms, and after that it seemed as though the great hills near the mouth of Blackwater Rush grew overnight. A crude motte-and-bailey fort, fifty feet high and with a cavernous longhall beneath it, was erected on Aegon's High Hill and another appeared on Visenya's Hill while an enormous wooden keep burst out of its walls on Rhaenys's Hill. From these glorious foundations there blossomed a great city which soon surrounded them: King’s Landing. It was here that Good Queen Alysanne affirmed court justice and reinforced her husband’s holy godly rule in the seven kingdoms one; she even visited every corner of the realm to encourage regularizing customs across Westeros.
The newly built motte-and-bailey fort, on the great hill near the mouth of Blackwater Rush, fifty feet high and an underground cavernous longhall beneath it roofed with slate in case of fire, had drawn people from far ends of the realm. Wealthy merchants tied up their ships along the riverside and springing up between Aegon's High Hill and Visenya's Hill was a modest market for cloth. Between Hills of Rhaenys and Visenya, a fish market sprung up along the riverside, with those gathered around being both wealthy or poor. Squalid who would normally remain hidden on even further crevices of Westeros were seen standing around Duskendale occasionally. The customs house appeared at King’s Landing as if it had burst out of its walls itself and a sept opened near Maidenpool commemorating Good Queen Alysanne where Richard Roote was appointed as High Septon.
Aegon's coronation was a grand affair, planned with as much care as Aegon had devoted to establishing his kingdom. He chose "King's Landing" for its symbolic value, only heightening the event's importance throughout Westeros and the Free Cities. The castles of Lannisport, Gulltown, White Harbor and Oldtown were all built upon his order by lords pledging allegiance to him; their efforts paid off when thousands gathered in King's Landing on the coronation day, many braving distances across land and sea to witness this momentous occasion. The city not only grew larger but more prosperous as well; gone were the squalid warehouses and small residences that had previously lined its streets - instead they were filled with wealthy merchants, vibrant markets and even bustling ports such as Maidenpool. At sunset over Dragonmont hill, Aegon shared his hopes for a true golden age – an era of peace where no one’s loyalty would be divided and everyone could reap the rewards of this thriving Kingdom.
Aegon, Rhaenys and Meraxes led a raid in the Summer Isles, they traveled thousands of miles to reach it. As the legend would say, they gave the Summer Islanders a chance to yield and submit before leading their men into battle. The Targaryens held true to this tradition, but after meeting much resistance they sieged the island with fire and sword. They sacked the villages ruthlessly and carried off much plunder for their efforts. Aegon felt that a ring of walls were needed to better defend these islands from future threats so he ordered their construction along with a massive gatehouse and defensive towers. Such was his will that Westeros itself soon followed suit as every corner of the realm worked on building its own defenses.
Ser Osmund had just returned from the Dornish War, where he had suffered a great loss of his sword hand. When Aegon heard about it, he was relieved and said that a King's Hand should have a hand, so he immediately named Lord Orys Baratheon as his fourth Hand. Aegon also called upon Lord Edmyn Tully to join the authority and before long Alton Celtigar was made part of it too, who at the time happened to be Roberts bastard half-brother. They reigned in these positions until they were replaced by Aegon I Targaryen’s son Aenys and his successors when they reached Westeros after sacking Tall Trees Town while raiding in the Summer Isles.
Grand Maester Gawen was present at the time of Aegon Targaryen's Conquest and kept track of all that had transpired, along with an army of lesser maesters to breed and train dragons and carry out his orders. As the Conqueror relied upon him to keep accurate records, not only did he write faithfully but also read greedily from every corner of the realm – unearthing tales long lost in evenfall halls or buried under farmer's field in distant lands. His great study now housed scrolls from Oldtown, The Eyrie, Dragonstone or Tarth - it echoed with stories of Viserys' greatness that Grand Maester Gawen strove hard to employ for his own brilliance. He remembered how House Corbray welcomed her sixteen Targaryens; how Lord Orys Baratheon first named Jon Arryn as fourth Hand; Good Queen Alysanne's crowning marriage with house Blackwood; Sixteen year old Torrhen Stark bowing before Aegon I; lords who stepped forth when King Jaehaerys could not settle Dornish War at Riverrun; Lord Edmyn Tully standing tall for loss of his sword hand and Alton Celtigar welcoming bastard half-brother as Robert returned relieved by news sent by Starry Sept declaring that Kings Hand should have a hand after all! Grand Maester Gawen relished these moments and more as he prepared himself to report on what would happen next to Aegon Targaryen at Dragonstone.
Aegon asked the Conclave of Maesters, assembled at the Citadel in Oldtown, to create what they believed was wisest and most learned man in all Seven Kingdoms. After much discussion and contemplation, Grand Maester Gawen emerged as their selection; a talented maester brought up from Dragonstone who had relied upon his knowledge and skills to help Aegon conquer and unify the land. The Grand Maester has continued since then to keep control over the landed lordships of Westeros through wise policies that rely upon supporting great houses with lesser ones, training competent men for services like writing and reading, or employing cunning strategies such as embroiling oneself in Dornish war-games. All this was done to ensure Aegon's realm remained strong throughout the far ends of the realm.
Archmaester Ollidar, Archmaester Lyonce and Grand Maester Gawen each had served the new King with exceptionaly excellence and so were selected to serve as Grand Maesters of the Seven Kingdoms. But, on their way from Casterly Rock to Citadel, misfortune stuck them after Gawen slipped in the mud and broken his leg. No one expected things to take a turn for worse until a distant cousin of Aegon the Dragon arrived at Evenfall Hall from Tarth claiming he should be the next ruler of Seven Kingdoms. Conclave was asked to create a team of wisest and most robust old maesters who could challenge this powerful challenger and restablish order in Westeros.
King Jaehaerys the Conciliator, a great and wise king, had consulted with Aegon I Targaryen after his conquering of the seven kingdoms. With input from the Grand Maesters, masters of coin and High Septon of Oldtown from Starry Sept, he instutioned the King’s Small Council to be his most trusted advisors. After touring through hallowed places such as King's Landing and Dragonstone, The Conciliator had also visited diverse territories like Oldtown in full bloom where he sought advice yearly. He was joined by Queens Rhaenys and Visenya on his visiting endeavor while seeking counsel from lords such as Lord Monkeyface and Evenstar of Tarth who gave opinions that aided in decisions often made in court by their wiser than thought grandfather.
Queen Rhaenys and Queen Visenya, having accompanied King Aegon on his glorious Conquests across the Seven Kingdoms, had proposed far-reaching reforms along the way. During their travels through Dornish Marches to the Wall and on to Summer Isles; they showered love, good will and bestowed grace upon each of the kingdoms they visited. It was even said that Queen Rhaenys composed small songs in celebration of her journey while Queen Visenya sang frivolously in praise of her brother's Conquest. Their footprints became legendary in every corner of the realm as they spread peace and prosperity like an Evergreen tree attaining full bloom during its' yearly cycle.
Queen Rhaenys was hailed as the 'The Queen Who Bore The Torch', due to her obsession with justice. Every day at the Aegonfort, she held court ensuring the smallfolk of seven kingdoms (save in Dorne) were getting their lawful rights. Her brothers and a select few others sat alongside her on the judgement seat, striking down those who did not comply with her rulings. When Queen Rhaenys saw a man and woman from Evenfall Hall arguing fiercely in front of her, she quickly chastised them for their frivolous behavior before producing an even tone that sang through her words. This charisma and special love earned from the Seven Kingdoms soon became glorious talk across borders all the way to far ends of Westeros, including The Free Cities and beyond.
Queen Rhaenys looked out over the Hill of Rhaenys, her gaze taking in the lush green fields and farms which surrounded it. Her gaze settled upon a small group of maesters and septons who had been summoned with consultation. The Queen listened to their wise counsel as they rendered justice upon those whom had broken the law; she chastised those for their transgressions yet taken pity when circumstances called for it, giving mercy where it was earned by the adulterous or faithful; finally she gave Lordship and Lawful rights to any who had proven themselves obedient subjects of hers. Soon, what news on this Hill reached every corner of the Seven Kingdoms; farmers from near and far lands knew that justice would be served from atop this mountaintop.
Queen Visenya kept her own fool and was known to frequently indulge in the ridicule of less fortunate people. At a feast, Visenya choked to death on a peach pit; however, she left behind one memorable figure in court - Lord Monkeyface. A hirsute creature of little fortune and even smaller brains, Queen Visenya dressed Lord Monkeyface up in all sorts of fantastical clothing befitting his unusualness - stories say she even acquired an ape for him once! The Queen shared an odd love for the fool that amused everyone from the maesters at Evenfall Hall to those septons who visited her at Visenya's Hill. Undoubtedly cleverer than his physical form would suggest, Lord Monkeyface has become an everlasting symbol throughout Westeros; especially during House Targaryen’s reign when many maids swooned over his hunchback charm as much were as they did with Aegon the Dragon himself!
Visenya Targaryen was a woman that demanded respect - her steady gaze, stern attitude and forthright manner only made it easier for people to understand just how much power she could wield. She delved deep into magic and the arcane arts, mixing spells and potions together with a mix of grim determination and unforgiving beauty. People whispered across far ends of the realm about all that Visenya was capable of, but none knew what secrets she kept hidden. While Queen Visenya had thrilled many in her lifetime with her hirsute ape companion Lord Monkeyface - who kept his own fool before he choked to death on a peach pit - as well as dressing him up in fine cloths during amusements at Evenfall Hall - there were also fewer who understood how clever or calculated this Targaryen sister could be.
Visenya Targaryen was in the midst of the Dornish War, wielding her sword with grim and unforgiving beauty. Her youngest brother Aegon urged her to protect their king from a Dornish cutthroat but she refused, instead slashing towards the cruel and suspicious enemy. The ferocity with which Visenya wielded her sword had been honed during her journey across Westeros with Aegon as they delved into every corner of the realm, mixing magic and steel. No one told them they couldn't reforge the world—and that is exactly what they were trying to do.
Aegon and Visenya rode together to the Seven Kingdoms, determined to form the Kingsguard to defend their people from ever surrendering again. The Kingsguard clad themselves in purest white, signifying their commitment to protectorate and honour, with oaths of chastity, obedience and service. Aegon's knights were only the finest of Westeros and were known for their ferocity just as much as their loyalty. When a Dornish cutthroat had surged forward towards him during the struggle of the Dornish War, Visenya urged him onward while Aegon refused - she slashed down with her blade twice before telling him that he should learn not be so suspicious if he hoped to live through such moments. All around them they could see evidence of his sister's kindness mixed amongst Grand Maester Gawen's Sixteen Targaryens - tales spread far and wide throughout all corners of the realm about even this small moment in time.
King Aegon and Visenya came forward to the tourney as required, holding great risk in their hands as they did so. All around them brave warriors made ready for the melee, each exhibiting the same skillful and worthy qualities that would be needed to protect those who sought passage through Seven Kingdoms. From the finest knights of Kingsguard defending against a surrendering enemy to humbly serve their lords following purest white cloaks of chasitity, obedience, and honor - all shared a common purpose. Now it was time for King Aegon and Visenya to choose from among this group, who shall carry forth with them into whatever may come next at far ends of realm.
All around the realm, brave men from every corner of the realm had come forward and those selected by King Aegon for his tourney at Visenya's Hill were a great and worthy lot. Young, old, tall, short, dark and fair from every circle came with their sons or heirs to prove themselves skilled enough to risk taking part in the melee required to choose an heir to sit upon the Iron Throne so that peace could be brought across Seven Kingdoms. Even bastards born or hedge knights had been selected among them in order give up their service for something greater. Those quick of wit and strong of arms, observant of raw talent and most importantly skilled in riding horses were all there vying for the chance at honor, riches and greatness.
Donning armor, Aegon and the other young men who had been selected gave up their lives to serve with valor. Richard Roote, Addison Hill, Gregor Goode, Griffith Goode, Humfrey the Mummer and Robin Darklyn were all brave men who rode out from Evenfall Hall in far ends of the realm along with Corlys Velaryon and Visenya Targaryen to face off against enemies from Tarth, Gulltown and beyond. Each was quick witted, strong of arm and exceptionally skilled in combat - traits that would prove invaluable as they fought for King Jaehaerys the Conciliator who sat on Aegon's Iron Throne.
Following Robert’s Rebellion, the Iron Throne was finally filled with Aegon the Dragon. But sixteen Targaryens were toppled in this long war and followed are considered wise or foolish, cruel or kind, good or evil by different people from far ends of the realm. It was a brave endeavor for all involved and led by heroes such as Richard Roote, Addison Hill and Gregor Goode to donning honorable armor for their respective houses. Alongside them were other characters like Humfrey the Mummer of House Harlaw and Robin Darklyn whose loyalty knew no bounds fighting for a dream now fulfilled. Corlys Velaryon served alongside his queen Visenya Targaryen through it all.
