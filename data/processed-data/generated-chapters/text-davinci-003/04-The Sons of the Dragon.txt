The wedding of King Aegon I Targaryen and his sister, Princess Rhaenys of House Targaryen was a grand affair, especially considering the Valyrian marriage customs. It was held in King's Landing over three days, with great feasts, famous knights competing in jousts and many people from across the Seven Kingdoms joining in the festivities. Many lords gave gifts of silver-gold to seal their loyalty to the new union whilst Queen Visenya took advantage of her renowned beauty and gave out garments dyed with purple – giving rise to true kings are unveiled unlike those before him.
The breaths were so tiny that it almost seemed as if Aenys, the first of King Aegon's sons and third born of His Grace and Queen Rhaenys, had never truly been born. But when he finally did cry, his parents feared that something was wrong with the small and sickly lad, so frail and spindly. Even the midwife suggested to give suck only watery, milk out of fear that she would not able to feed such a child. Yet despite all odds, Aenys thrived — luckily growing into a healthy young man unlike his bend brother Jaehaerys at home in Dragonstone who remained small and homely even though handsome.
Prince Aenys had always been a bit lost in the shadows of his siblings, but when Queen Rhaenys and Meraxes were slain in Dorne,, even King Aegon feared for him. He stopped eating and appeared to be inconsolable, until suddenly he set off one day on his own accross Westeros. Everywhere he went it seemed people would comment on how comely the prince was for being so small and sickly as an infant; however unlike his beautiful sister Rhaena or handsome brother Aegon, Prince Aenys had never thrived. Though much to everyones's surprise, wherever this slender boy journeyed people filled with pitty spake his praises eagerly hoping that he would bring change against what they saw as unfornate legacy of Aegon's children - claiming if only he had been crowned none of this tragedy may have befallen them under the false impression that because Aenyas was not born by watery ooze...he might sway fate in their favor.
After speculation had ended, Queen Visenya announced that she was carrying a child of the King's and proclaimed confidently that a newborn would come squalling into the world soon. This news spread like wildfire amongst the kingdom and through her entourage, as word of her news travelled to Dorne and even across the narrow sea, to Tyrosh or perhaps Volantis. Everyone agreed that the unborn baby - if robust - twice-over blessed by both Old gods and The Drowned God would bring great joys in Westeros. Both Lannisters of Casterly Rock and people of King's Landing awaited with bated breath for news of this royal blessing.
Prince Aenys, the eldest of King Aegon and Queen Visenya Targaryen's sons, remained steadfast in Aegonfort as heir apparent when his royal progress took them to Dragonstone and King’s Landing. His half-brother Prince Maegor was often close by and yet not always amicable with him. Holding court on behalf of the king was a prominent duty for both princes, seeing off many vassals from Vhagar to Duskendale. The queen dowager had found refuge in Driftmark where she held many grand balls in honor of their brothers grandchildren that lived in Alys Harroway's House Velaryon within the Great Fork of the Blackwater. Their famous knights Ser Harys Horpe, Theo Bolling and Malcolm Blanetree were just some that came closer than others to serve House Targaryen during this time throughout this realm.
Queen Visenya and Ser Gawen Corbray had arrived at the castle amidst the royal progress and remained in close proximity with King Aegon, Prince Aenys, and her half-brother Maegor. To the surprise of those present, Queen Visenya put forth a deadly plan that she had devised—to butcher one of the castle cats. She chose Ser Gawen as her accomplice and two took to carrying out the strange phrase—one they would all remember forever. Rollingford nearby fell into dismay; rumor of Her Grace's dark deeds spread all around House Tyrell, Lord Edwell Celtigar, The Vulture Kings domain where Vaella rules from Tully waterside and Quenton Qoherys can cross anytime. Even in distant corners like Osmund Strong’s King Harren stronghold in Lannisport or Larissa Velaryon court on Driftmark Isle far away news travelled quickly concerning Queen Visenya's deeds at Castle Aegonfort.
Prince Aenys of House Targaryen, accompanied by four members of Aegon's Kingsguard, came to Aeogon's court in the castle. They were all known for their diligent courage and adequate service that had often been pressed upon them. After putting all other matters aside, Queen Viserney devised a plan with Ser Gawen Corbray in which they took Prince Aeneys away from the court and to Rollingford, a nearby place governed by House Tyrell. There they chose to butcher one of the castle cats as an offering to The Drowned God — something once done by Maegor Targaryen and Vaella during her tenure as the Vulture King.
Prince Aenys came to Aegon's court as instructed, pressed by his oft diligent and courageous rule. He was possessed of a dote for the ride, often giving his fine steed strong sweet caresses and gentle pats on its neck. Quicksilver, too, earned the prince’s attention with his courteous and charming behavior that was accompanied by a cleverness that only a highborn low equine could own.
Prince Maegor Targaryen rode in the castle yard on a fine strong sweet steed, proudly unhorsing boys four and five years his elder in the lists and battering seasoned men-at-arms into submission. His skill with weapons unmatched and his quick to take offense, slow to forgive demeanor made him a fearsome force across Westeros. He showed great love for animals, but when a stableboy failed to attend the prince's mount properly he kicked the stableboy in the stables and stabbed the horse to death instead of simply taking offense and forgiving as expected from so highborn of noble blood. He then slashed half the face off the stableboy, bestowing her own Valyrian steel blade, Dark Sister, upon him as an apology. Yet it was more signal than apology; no one would dare cross Prince Maegor now.
The Targaryens often married kin to kin and wed brother to sister, seeking power in the ancient and pure Valyrian blood that ran through their veins. When that failed, they would even take more than one wife, though such practices were seen as incestuous by the culture of the Seven Kingdoms. Ser Harys of the Kingsguard remembered his past king, Aegon I Targaryen and how he had bestowed her own Valyrian steel blade, Dark Sister upon prince Maegor Targaryen at Old Valyria for showing a fearsome prowess and skill with weapons unmatched since then. The old knight also found it hard to fathom how Maegor who seemed so quick to take offense was slow to forgive sometimes could seem like any other boy – kicking stableboys in stables or slashing half a face off one or stabbed a horse or unhorsing boys four an five times his elder in lists – yet all was forgiven due to his great love for animals -- if not foe then those very same boy later earned places among household knights Maegor had brought form Old Valyria when most their families came down with them too.
In Westeros, the old gods were still worshipped and hand down through the centuries Valyrian marriage customs were considered an ancient, pure and noble thing. When Aegon I began his conquest many pious lords denounced the Targaryen's incestuous habits - taking more than one wife and marrying kin to kin - but Lord Hightower was counseled against opposing the dragon. The High Septon of Oldtown was expected to speak out against Aegon and his sisters but instead he blessed and anointed him at his second coronation. This act proved that incestuous marriage practices were considered true even in Andalos despite being abominations in sight of gods and men.
The High Septon had grown accustomed to the Valyrian marriage customs, and although he didn't necessarily agree that Aegon should marry both of his sisters, Rhaenys and Visenya, at the same time he remained compliant in honoring them. In order to show respect for the Faith, Aegon exempted those of Westeros who worshipped the old gods from coronation rites and affirming some nobles familiarity with traditional ceremonies. Once crowned Aegon the Conqueror, known true in Andalos as well as across Seven Kingdoms, the High Septon considered it a vile sin in sight of gods and men; yet still blessed and anointed him at his second coronation.
Aegon I, His Grace the King and High Septons were relieved to have finally granted the accord between the Faith and the Iron Throne. While Aegon had grown accustomed to remaining behind courtesies like poison, simmering below, he still took care to honor the familiar traditional exemptions by affirming all of House Tyrell across Rollingford's behalf. As tribute His Grace had called upon his High Holiness The Seven, residing in Oldtown's Starry Sept, who believed that this may have been inevitable. However many of those present disagreed feeling that while familiarity was established some things just can't continue forever - not even with a Targaryen King alive.
Aegon the Conqueror father no daughters, but he did seek to continue the ancient accord between the Faith and the Iron Throne which had been simmering below courtesies like poison for generations. In order to put an end to this, the Dragon himself onboarded Ser Harys from House Tyrell, Septon Pater from Rollingford and Princess Deria from Oldtown - all with their own agendas. Aegon went as far as calling on Lord Father of Starry Sept at High Holiness of Stonedance by inviting even Lord Buckwell and his kin of Drowned God who lived in Bywater. Even Lords Tully and Qoherys could not be forgotten along with Larissa Velaryon, the Vulture King's niece, Vaella when discussing matters related to the continued unresolved quarrel.
Prince Aenys and Lady Alyssa were wed in a ceremony at Tides, steeped in ancient Valyrian marriage customs. Amidst the silvery waves of the sea and purple hues of evening light, Allard Royce his betrothed Jeyne Westerling, a feast laid out by Lord of the Tides himself and witnessed by King Aegon himself, Prince Aethan Velaryon, Alyn Tarbeck and other noble lords. Reckoned a maiden fit for ancient Valyrian wedding rites shared between some of royalty’s most revered houses Targaryen and Velaryon; making her brother, Arya Stark's cousin with whom she was often mischievous as a child very proud.
Lady Alyssa and Prince Aenys were wed in the Tides by a Lord of the Tides as per ancient Valyrian marriage customs. Nine moons after their wedding, Lady Alyssa proved to befertile and gave birth to a small, healthy girl they named Rhaena who had lilac coloured eyes and silver hair. King Aegon wept when he saw his newest grandchild; He doted on her greatly, happy to witness new life blossoming in his kingdom. The court rejoiced along with the royal family on this happy occassion but none more than Princess Alyssa for it seemed she had at last found purpose in life through motherhood.
The glad tidings of Aenys' daughter, Rhaena's birth spread quickly and soon reached all throughout the Seven Kingdoms. Even before Rhaena was named, the issue as to whether Prince Maegor remains second in the line of succession was raised by House Tyrell who felt entruiged by her small yet healthy lilac eyes that proved she had taken after her mother, Visenya Targaryen. The prospect of betrothing the infant to Maegor uncertainly stirred up a commotion but King Aegon listened to Ceryse Hightower and Manfred Hightower who spoke against it and agreed that Rhaena should be unquestioned heir in line for Iron Throne while Maegor receives an additional lands and titles from Oldtown and other outlying regions as consolation. When sent a raven warning the king of any such ambitions among his court, Aegon rejoiced knowing that Rhaena would remain unfettered despite Lord Father's desire for a Valyrian marriage customs for their son and reluctancy to agree on proposed betrothing with Poxy Jeyne Poore.
At the Starry Sept of Oldtown, a lusty dozen were present to bear witness as Lord Maegor Targaryen and Lady Ceryse Hightower wed. It was on that same night that they consummated the marriage, much to the delight of the High Septon who had come expressly for performing such sacred rites. At once proclaiming them husband and wife, he then sent a raven across the Seven Kingdoms with glad tidings of such news. Though rumors of House Tyrell's disdain for this union had been reaching out from Highgarden before long, nothing could stop Queen Visenya from rejoicing in her son taking his first steps into adulthood - one unquestioned heir greater than before!
As the son of Maegor Targaryen and Lady Ceryse Hightower, Aegon was born in the Seven Kingdoms and swept away by his father shortly after they had bedding ceremonies before the High Septon in Starry Sept of Oldtown. Upon hearing this news, people debated what would follow but little did they know that the robust and fierce warrior’s blood ran through Aegon’s veins as Maegor fathered him with a Lannister from Casterly Rock. The acclaim for Prince Aenys, Princess Alys and Rhaena now paled at Aegon's entrance into the world, some even began to refer to him as Aegon the Dragon - how foreboding!
King Aegon and Queen Visenya of House Targaryen had two sons, Prince Aegon and Alyssa. Soon after the birth of their children, news swept through the Seven Kingdoms debating who should follow next in line to become the leader. King Aegon would soon be one of many rulers that fathered robust and fierce warriors who roamed from land to land across Westeros. Much joy came from other kingdoms when Queen Visenya's delightful little ones came into this world. Queen Visenya set aside time for each prince and princess as they grew up which included her daughter, Alysanne and three more princes: Prince Viserys, Jaehaerys, and Aenys. As time passed on it was clear who will follow after King Aegon - his robust son with a warrior’s spirit that would conquer nations like his father before him - Prince Maegor Targaryen.
Prince Aenys, Princess Rhaena, and Grand Maester Gawen observed the whimsical laughter of their aunt, Queen Alyssa, from the castle balcony with delight. Whenever one of her little children hid behind a chair or clung to her skirts for love, she would feed them sweets and provided comforting words as a mother should. Though shy at first, Rhaena eventually joined in on the delightful little group that included Prince Aegon and his siblings when Lady Ceryse Hightower of House Tyrell came to town from Rollingford with servants in tow. The dreamy princess had gone past her usual melancholic state; she even giggled once or twice like all the other children who joined their family reunion. In response to this unexpected joy, those present beheld in silent awe these moments where familial bonds were restored and strengthened before their eyes.
Princess Rhaena was presented with a hatchling from the pits of Dragonstone, and it bonded instantly with her. With every moment that passed, her shyness faded away as she grew more resilient in their bond. It was named Dreamfyre and took to the skies for the first time; however, Larissa Velaryon of evenstar of Tarth and Samantha Stokeworth's lives at home in Driftmark were suddenly recalled when they were expected to wed according to Valyrian marriage customs. Rhaena could only observe from afar with
Princess Rhaena, Alysanne, and Jaehaerys Targaryen had just put a dragon's egg in Princess Alysanne's cradle. The legends said their names would be writ so large in the annals of years to come that it echoed throughout every court from Westeros to Indeed, across the Freeholds of Valyria even down to Andalos. As news spread throughout Westeros of the legendary Targaryen progeny presented with a hatchling from Dragonstone—bonded instantly and taking flight for the first time—Larissa Velaryon was suddenly recalled to Driftmark by House Tyrell to be wed. Despite her shyness and timidity on the ground she found an inner resilience while soaring through heavens with Dreamfyre; running away was never an option as her fate would intertwined with theirs forever more.
The news of Princess Rhaena and Prince Maegor's love spread far and wide all over the Seven Kingdoms, creating a joyful atmosphere when, despite being childless, they remained devoted to each other. Even Queen Visenya and Aenys' daughters, Lady Ceryse - renowned for her piety - celebrated heartily. Little did they know however that their names would be writ so large in the annals of the years to come with a legendary tale of dragon eggs placed in cradles throughout Westeros by members of House Targaryen.
Prince Maegor felt uneasy as he watched the competition in Riverrun's tourney and melee. His eyes narrowed as his Kingsguard was unhorsed, and soon a young knight from House Blackfyre had been dubbed victorious. As the cheers of the crowd filled his uncle's castle, he thought of what lay ahead for him back in King's Landing. With his aunt, Dowager Queen Visenya Targaryen there to keep an eye on him and her son Prince Aegon leading Aenys' daughters in piousness - all would be more joyous if he could find love there like had shared with Lady Ceryse of House Hightower before she was pushed away due to their childless relationship. He remained hopeful that someday someone would fill the void left by Ceryse and bring back gladness into his life.
Prince Maegor, having distinguished himself at the tourney and melee at Riverrun, now confidently followed Osmund Strong and his close companions Aethan Velaryon and Sargoso Saan into the Stepstones as part of a mission to root out the Lysene pirate king. He accompanied them fearlessly as they hunted down notorious robber knights in the Riverlands, wielding his Valyrian steel sword Dreadflame with deadly precision and effectiveness. With him rode The Giant of the Trident, a towering figure from Westeros who was said to have done fell deeds during Aegon I’s conquest centuries ago. Together they fought against anyone who dared oppose them, striking terror into their enemies' hearts wherever they went and earning themselves renown throughout all Seven Kingdoms.
Maegor, accompanied by Aethan Velaryon, arrived back home at Dragonstone with a dozen hatchlings born amidst the fires. They were followed by Aegon and Rhaena who had taken to the sky astride their dragon Dreamfyre. Lady Alyssa refused to be teased and replied that these young dragons would make Westeros tremble in awe of them one day. The Sons of the Vulture King spread fear as they set out to visit many places with Maegor leading them as they fought against lord Allard Royce's Four False Kings, rooted out the Lysene pirate king Sargoso Saan alongside House Tyrell and hunted down and slew a notorious robber knight in Andalos - Fearless and deadly in battle.
Prince Aenys and Deria Martell, daughter of the Lord Father of Dorne, journeyed to Sunspear to celebrate the indepence of Dorne from the westermen and riverlords. Maegor Targaryen came to support them with an entourage fit for royalty, including Aegon the Conqueror himself. The entire court celebrated in peace away from King's Landing under the watchful eye of Aegon whom refused all teasing along his frustrations at being so far from home. From Dragonstone a dozen hatchlings had been born amidst flames while Rhaena took to sky holding her dreamfyre with Lady Alyssa by her side. Young as they were, their ambitions brought them closer together as surely as if everyone could sense a forthcoming destiny that would forever shape Westeros.
Aegon and his entourage of high lords landed in a fishing village, having grown swollen with many more wishing to join them on the journey. As they spread across Westeros, what had been some scattered and peaceful settlements before quickly became sprawling cities of great confusion. Everywhere were immense amounts of people as well as unplanned, impermanent structures that made the place stinking and dirty, reeking with a certain disorientation among its residents. As Aegon continued to High Hill from there, it was clear that their ambition for planned cities instead of these still flimsy and ugly ones was not only shared but expanding steadily.
Aegon moved quickly, giving orders as he went. With Queen Visenya's help, he decreed the construction of a castle on Dragonstone in 35AC and named Lord Alyn Stokeworth to oversee its fit out. Ser Osmund Strong was chosen to complete the tasks and vermithor from the Red Keep, with great confusion and excitement erupting amongst Aegon's entourage. By doing so, it seemed that their ruler had begun his campaign for the Seven Kingdoms in earnest.
Viserys and Prince Maegor stood in the castle yard, watching as Aegon was laid upon a funeral pyre. Viserys spoke of how showing honor to a great king such as Aegon, who had moved to Dragonstone 37 years ago after the Conquest, decreeing that Lord Alyn Stokeworth should oversee all construction until it was fit for a ruling King, was more important than any ritual they could perform. Queen Visenya supplied all of the wood to be burned while Ser Osmund Strong retrieved Blackfyre and laid it across his chest with his mailed hands folded over the hilt and his blade darker but elsewise unharmed. As everyone watched on solemnly in silence, Lady Ceryse Hightower stepped forward with her son Allard Royce by her side and struck the pyre alight in accordance with Valyrian customs. The flames engulfed King Aegon and Blackfyre until nothing remained of them both but ashes.
Visenya and Aenys, the two surviving Dragon children of Maegor's father's death, were five-and-twenty and thirty years respectively. When news of their father's passing arrived at Dragonstone, Lord Hightower from House Tyrell was in residence and supplied vast amounts of resources for the funeral pyre ceremonies with Septon Pater from Rollingford traveling to retrieve Blackfyre for what would be Maegor’s ceremonial burning in The 37th Year After the Conquest. As his mailed hands folded under the hilt of Blackfyre and its blade darker but elsewise unharmed, a solemn quiet fell over Castle Yard as Viserys spoke words showing his respect for his brother’s legacy.  In that moment, people forgot their worries even if it were only fleeting; Lord Tyrell set forth plans to organize serval religious pilgrimages across Westeros with Princess Deria of Oldtown following closely behind him swearing support to those pious lords who joined on the journey.
When King Aenys passed away, the entire realm mourned. A funeral with grandeur and respect was held at his beloved Highgarden. Maegor and Quicksilver, brothers of Aenys, donned the finest clothing they could find in their wardrobe while Gawen, a distant cousin of theirs from Dragonstone knelt before them to pay his respects. As a final tribute to their father's passing, the brothers drew forth twin swords made of iron-and-ruby which were crafted for him when he declared himself king five-and-twenty years ago. They then presented it to each other in solemnity and kissed it as a symbol of honor; this drew ancient Valyrian marriage customs back into memory among people of Westeros. The funeral was accompanied by pious lords from far and wide paying homage to the late King Aenys while servants presented them with offerings once they bowed or knelt before him. Amidst all this chaos, Dowager Queen Visenya watched quietly as her son Maegor proclaimed himself King after thirty years ruling as Prince of Dragonstone.
The Dowager Queen Visenya was ill at ease as she arrived in Dragonstone. Accompanied by her son the Prince Maegor and their entourage, the fortress of their House had become a home for death. Their mourning for her late father, Aenys, took on an added solemnity when it became time to perform the bequest; the gifting of his iron-and-ruby coronet to Maegor. Proving he possessed both the strength and wisdom to properly wield such power would not come unwisely what with all four False Kings lurking around Westeros later that year.
On their journey to King's Landing, Queen Visenya and Prince Maegor were accompanied by a huge entourage, including Ser Harys Velaryon, Septon Pater of House Tyrell, Lord Father Rollingford as well as some knights from the Kingsguard. As they arrived back to Dragonstone and completed the funeral rites of King Aengon I and sailed to King’s Landing, they saw that Iron Throne still stood. The old Aegonfort had been torn down; yet its ruins still pockmarked the city where Aenys claimed his father’s seat as the new king. Meanwhile, Lady Ceryse Hightower already assembled her household which included even Lucifer Massey among many famous knights of Westeros such as Warior's Sons Davos Baratheon or Ser Tyler Hill.
His Grace, Queen Alyssa and the royal entourage set out to receive the blessing of the High Septon at Oldtown. With his four eldest children, Aenys and Princess Rhaena leading Quicksilver on their fourteen year old Alysanne’s beautiful mare they traveled across the Dornish Marches and a few short days on Quicksilver's back passed through Highgarden, Storm's End and King's Landing. As they rode past The Red Keep pockmarked from years of warring fought to claim the Iron Throne still stood strong as a reminder of when Aenys first claimed it in place of his father Aegon I unfinished dreams. Finally arriving in Oldtown after an arduous journey, His Grace offered thanks for Lord Father Tyrell’s hospitality during their stay before returning home to Kings Landing seven moons later with his granddaughter Jeyne Westerling as is tradition amongst Valyrian marriage customs.
Aegon, Viserys and Princess Rhaena, the new king and queen of Westeros, rode towards Storm's End accompanied by their entourage. A great cheer came from the smallfolk as they appeared on Quicksilver, an exceptionally beautiful horse gifted to them for their coronation. Orys Baratheon was mounted alongside them. Lady Melony had been sent for when Queen Alyssa refused rudely to join in the celebrating with the lords and ladies at Storm's End, having put aside her former shyness. Everywhere the royal court stopped during their arduous journey was filled with feasts and frolics put on in honor of their new monarchs who had received great fanfare from all corners of Westeros that day.
Dowager Queen Visenya Targaryen, accompanied by Ser Harys, Septon Pater, and many of House Tyrell's lords and ladies made their way to the Starry Sept for a grand ceremony. After High Septon Father of the Faithful had anointed Aenys Targaryen as the new King with a crown inlaid with yellow gold, jade and pearl whispered through crowds suggesting that such a blessing should not have been given so soon after Viserys refused rudely when sent for Lady Melony Piper from Rollingford to join in the celebrations at Storm's End . But despite all doubts, Aenys put aside his former shyness and reluctance, as he looked around him at the cheering smallfolk who welcomed him as their new monarch.
As the castle gates opened and King Aenys Targaryen emerged from the Starry Sept, he was surrounded by a crowd of lords, knights, sons and other retainers. His entourage prepared to embark on his Wars of Conquest that would define him as one who forged an empire unlike anything ever imagined or avenged before it. The realm remembered the legacy left by Old Valyria and responded with adulation and cries for new glory firmly fixed on their lips. As he looked around at familiar faces- some strong, some handsome men- all willing to follow him into battle in service to their need to win, he remembered long-dead ancestors and those smallfolk whose faithfulness had only grown since his anointment. But this time was different —he could almost feel something more tangible in the air, like a promise reverberating through all in attendance that if they went forward together—their future would be new but marked with much higher stakes than any conqueror had ever set before…
Aegon, the Uncrowned King, rode into Harrenhal with his host of Knights, Lords and their Sons. He had remembered the Wars of Conquest vividly and wanted to avenge the smallfolk they had oppressed in that long-dead time. At Harrenhal he was granted possession over Gargon, who had become known as "the foolish fat Lord" for his unseemly and unwelcome ways. When Quenton Qoherys turned up at Harrenhal with news of stirrings of revolt, Aegon made free with supplies from House Tyrell and set off for Rollingford in the riverlands. Little did Monarch know that by this misfortunate fall from his horse in Riverrun, he would be ushering in an age where his House and faith are forged anew – finally giving them a chance to strike and win back what was so sorely needed.
King Aenys, Lord Tully of Riverrun and Lord Qoherys soon arrived at the castle godswood with all of their entourage that included Harren the Red and Harren the Black who Guested together with them. As it so happened, King Aenys had opened up a postern gate at Harrenhal and almost exposed his army to danger. Fortunately, Lord Jon Lychester pulled him away just in time while Lord Ronnel Arryn declared him leal from all charges. What came next was unforgivable as Gargon dragged Quenton Qohreys away and sliced off his head to be fed to crows. It was then that Aegon had become known around Westeros for making free with unwise decisions thus gaining an unwelcome reputation for being foolish and fat.
Lord Tully of Riverrun urged his Grace Aenys to summons his banners and lingered at Riverrun as they gathered. Soon, the outer gates of Harrenhal opened to a small but powerful force, led by Lord Gargon from Dorne. As commanded, the march for Harrenhal began..but when his men reached Harrenhal, they found it empty but for corpses. Every member of House Hightower had been put to death in such a way that echoed the Valyrian marriage customs - none taken alive and all taken by surprise. As tension rose through Westeros from this troubling event, mysterious rumors born from Samwell Tarly assigned blame on even more fantastical enemies's outside The Realm; across the narrow sea, to Tyrosh or perhaps Volantis came tales of Giants of The Trident hiring both handsome men and homely ones alike with gold dragons paying homage at their feet in some unholy union. 
Aenys commanded Lord Ronnel Arryn to dethrone and imprison his younger brother Jonos. However, the lord's order was soon overshadowed by the reappearance of Lodos the Twice-Drowned claiming to be the son of The Drowned God, returned from visiting his father. Morale was lifted for those loyal to Lodos' claim as he called on all true Dornishmen to avenge the evils visited upon them by Targaryens. Princess Deria denounced him and swore that she wanted only peace in return. To make matters worse, news quickly spread throughout Westeros soft murmurs leading up to what would become known as "The Vulture King", which saw thousands flock to his banners swarm down from hills and up out of Red Mountains of Dorne and Reach towards King’s Landing.
Vulture King and his rabble of half-mad, undisciplined and unwashed followers stormed and seized the castle of Blackhaven. When Lord Harmon Dondarrion spoke against him, Vulture King had sliced off his head while those who wrote in support of him had to face the smell of their burning homes as Vulture King put Blackhaven to the torch and marched away with a triumphal spirit. Meanwhile, word had spread across The Realm about the reappearance of Lodos the Twice-Drowned claiming he was sent by The Drowned God on a mission that called for justice for millennia old wrongs visited upon them by Targaryens. With Princess Deria denouncing him, news was carried even back to Westeros where everyone from kings to maesters cursed at its worst implications.
When King Aenys put down the last of the rebels who had stormed and seized his castle of Blackhaven, he knew something had gone terribly wrong. Grand Maester Gawen confirmed this when he spoke with Lord Jonos Arryn and Lodos, The Vulture King - they had been wronged. The king sent out countermanded orders to hunt down the undisciplined rabble, half mad with fear and blood lust that had put Blackhaven to the torch and marched away. His Grace vowed to make things right by sending representatives from Dragonstone, The Vale, and even Kings Landing to speak directly to those smallfolk who now lived in terror of retribution from their former leaders such as Alyssa and Ronnel but especially from Harren the Red who were infamous for their cruelty.
As King Allard Royce assembled his loyal twoscore bannermen, Lord Jonos Arryn, alongside Ronnel Arryn, prevaricated at Runestone instead of immediately heeding the king's orders to march against the Eyrie. After a demand was made for their release and knowing they were wronged by relation to those at the Vale, they spoke of sending another through the Moon Door in their stead. With barely a few words between them all in the midst of this chaos, Jonos knew what had to be done and sent his brother to fulfill it; comprehending that should any strikes against him be countermanded then his actions will have marked him as an outlaw intent on hunting down his own smallfolk.
The siege of The Eyrie had been going on for months and tensions were high, as Lord Allard Royce seemed to have no intention of yielding. With him was his son, Jonos Arryn, who with Lord Ronnel Arryn at his side, spat fiercely at their opponents from behind the thick castle walls. While both sides had resorted to conventional methods of warfare in the beginning, it quickly grew more desperate as the die-hard loyalists under King Maegor refused to budge an inch - despite having suffered grievous losses. When finally settled upon by all parties involved, Jonos’s victory was claimed a greatest amongst those assembled beneath Runestone and marched against the Vale; twoscore loyal bannermen flew beneath his own eagles even still.
Prince Maegor Targaryen had succeeded in his siege of the Eyrie, causing Jonos and House Arryn to surrender after the spat was settled. After Lord Royce delivered Balerion to the Moon Door, opened it, and served as a witness while Prince Maegor took possession of the castle, those who denied him the honor of dying by sword were hanged naked from walls of The Eyrie. Hubert Arryn took control as pretender to provide a sense of peace and stability; it seemed that Ser Harys' plea for a conventional die-hard fighter had been answered. Little did they know, however, that this would be one of Maegor's greatest deeds and mark one turning point in Westerosi history.
When Lord Goren Greyjoy offered a boin to King Aenys in return for expelling all the septons and septas from the Iron Islands, there was a similar swift agreement. In no time thousands of pious lords were marshalling within Old Wyk, sending ships towards Great Wyk and descend southwards asking for aid. This offered an opportunity for people like Ser Harys Horpe who descended on Kings Landing with his entourage bringing Septon Pater from House Tyrell of Rollingford, Princess Deria Martell, her son Lord Father, members of Kingsguard as well as Aegon I‘s trusted followers like Lord Buckwell and even some devotees of the Drowned God while they denied the honor of dying by sword. All those who pledged their allegiance to the pretender were hanged naked from walls at the Eyrie or strangled slowly and installed where appropriate - offering those like Hubert Arryn a chance at being saved one more time.
Princess Deria, daughter of Lord Walter Wyl and the Vulture King from Sunspear, found a strong support in the rebellion against Iron Islands rule when thousands of young men from across the Realm joined her. With them swelling their numbers, from Westermen and Riverlords to Old Valyrians, they marched towards Nightsong to besiege one of the largest holdings of King Aenys' forces threatening to double-game him. The seasoned military force was enormously larger than anything Lord Goren Greyjoy had sent before; even so, by sending such an enormous force so swift after offering a boin to King Aenys - asking him in similar terms to expel all the septons and septas from the Iron Islands - Princess Deria might have caused an issue of marshalling lords loyal to House Tyrell that remained divided.
Orys Baratheon and Orys One-Hand had met with Lord Walter Wyl at Storm’s End, and after riding forth, they smashed through Stonehelm in an effort to take control of the symbolically important location. They took it and claimed leadership over it even as the Vulture King marched towards Nightsong, threatening to besiege one of the largest cities in the Kingdom. As their rebellion had joined forces during this momentous event, support for their cause swelled enormously - eventually dividing people into two camps who faced off at what became known as The Last Rebellion. Despite his veteran status in battle experience, Walter Wyl was not ready for what ensued that day; but Davos Seaworth remained hopeful that something could be salvaged from the situation in order to eliminate any further consequences.
The Vulture King had laid siege to Blackhaven for many weeks now and rumors of his plan had spread amid the citizens of Horn Hill. As he began to march outward from Blackhaven, Lord Samwell Tarly of Horn Hill rode forth with a strong force eager to crush the enemy's power and rescue Lady Caron from the besieged castle. A battle ensued, and despite throwing everything at each other no side gained an advantage in what seemed like an everlasting conflict. That is, until Savage Sam Tarly appeared at the very front of the battlefield brandishing a great Valyrian steel blade; their fate was sealed as every last man loyal to The Vulture King broke away and abandoned the fight upon seeing him, never to seem again. He had single handedly delivered them victory! Justice was served after such a long struggle.
The Second Dornish War was called upon when the Vulture King and Savage Sam Tarly descended on Horn Hill, intent on taking it for revenge. The fierce battle that ensued saw many perish and others tied or even torn apart by troops of the Second Dornish War. However, Princess Deria Martell was one such lucky soul to be accounted a rebel force and managed to barely escape naked from the strong force that had appeared out of nowhere, throwing them back in disarray. Even after all this, what still remains unclear is the outcome of this latest march against the Vulture King's forces.
Harren the Red had proved himself to be a powerful enemy during the Second Dornish War, wanting to take account of all he had lost in his previous rebellion against King Aegon I Targaryen. His defeat came swiftly when he was brought to bay in a village west of the Gods Eye, where Lord Alyn Stokeworth, Hand of the King, and Bernarr Brune, Commander of the Kingsguard fought for Alexander Targaryen's honor. Harren and his men perished naked on that riverside battle whilst Davos Baratheon, Samwell Tarly and No-Nose Dondarrion conferred their highest honors upon Lord Alyn Stokeworth with bestowal from Queen Aerea Tyrell herself. Even Ellyn Caron meekly accepted her greatest failure and bowed before Allard Royce and Goren Greyjoy - both infamous commanders loyal to Prince Maegor Targaryen himself.
The amity between the Dragon’s sons did not long endure. Out in King's Landing and across Westeros, members of House Tyrell, Baratheon and Targaryen alike conferred their blessings upon their children in an effort to quell any tension that could brew up between them. The People of Kings Landing watched on meekly as the Deria Martell bestowed a generous dowry onto her son, while Allard Royce gifted his daughter Alysanne with jewels from all across the land. Goren Greyjoy bested even these grand displays by having his men build a tower tall enough to reach the gods themselves. However despite this great show of wealth, it seemed nothing would convince Prince Maegor who had already sworn fealty to no-one since he'd been imprisoned at Visenya's Hill by his aunt Dowager Queen Visenya Targaryen.
As King Aenys loved to dally and delighted in the finer things of life, he wore the finest clothes, lived freely among his people like Aegon's I the Conqueror had done before him - yet he had no patience for those who did not bend to his will. Grand Maester Gawen sought counsel from His Grace but in answer was shouted down, as King Aenys remarked upon the swaying of others to his Heed and even different customs with a fearsomely strong hand. All maesters regarded him with fear and awe as his savagery in the field was unyielding and unbending.
Queen Alyssa continued to rule with King Aenys amicably, despite the shock that was felt when he suddenly announced he had taken a second wife. The Queen had a daughter Vaella with him, which was proof of the queen’s fertility and she also made sure Lady Ceryse and Alys Harroway from House Harroway were treated amicably at court. Lord of Harrenhal and others in the Realm all accepted this change uncomfortably but King Aenys did not heed their fears as he was fearsomely strong yet had a fine way about his savagery in the field. He (un)yielding (un)bending nature meant Queen Alyssa's position at court would remain unchanged for many years to come.
Prince Maegor, who had traveled to Dragonstone for his wedding officiated by the septon, quarreled with King Aenys when the High Septon made protest against the Valyrian marriage customs demanding the acceptance of multiple wives. Unperturbed, King Aenys refused and denounced such customs in a deep thundered voice that permeated across Dragonstone Castle. Lady Ceryse accompanied by her daughter Alys were both shocked while many pious lords present gasped at what they had heard. This further legitimized Queen Visenya Targaryen’s sudden announcement of taking a second wife to prove her fertility and continued rule alongside Queen Alyssa amicably back in The Realm with King Aenys.
Prince Maegor had remained steadfast in his commitment to take a wife and rule alongside King Aenys. When they journeyed to Oldtown - a place of healing and piety - stoked with Valyrian marriage customs, the High Septon opened the union between Prince Maegor and Lady Ceryse of House Hightower, sister of Lord Manfred. Yet when several pious lords spoke out against this defiance, denouncing such a sacrilegious act, the Dowager Queen Visenya thundered them into submission; for her brother King Maegor I Targaryen had declared that any man who protested at his niece’s marriage would be condemned. As she opened up court to speak on behalf of her son, it said all there was to know: no amount of protesting or condemning could tear apart what fate had put together.
Prince Maegor was vexed. He had been left abandoned by his father King Aenys, who had put aside their marriage in light of the ensuing chaos. So he did what any angry Targaryan prince would do: he departed Pentos with Lady Ceryse and Balerion, as well as the famous Blackfyre. Lord of Alys Harroway, a noblewoman from Oldtown, joined them on his quest to prove that despite being condemned and spoken against by many pious lords and septons, his time for ruling could truly heal Westeros from the turmoil that has opened up since Aegon's reign ended. An entourage filled with squires and handsome young men followed closely behind him as they set off to King's Landing once more - not just to reclaim his throne but also to see if he could right all the wrongs which had been visited upon him. He left behind Poxy Jeyne Poore in exile despite her son hanging onto her hand tightly unwilling for her mother to go away; yet Maegor remained defiant in restoring justice to will be served…
King Aenys and Septon Murmison led the nightly ritual in King's Landing. The solemn procession was held to help heal, replace, and make fecund His Grace the king's subjects while they thundered the Seven laws and prayed for pious rulers. As they reached Oldtown Hightower, the High Septon identified all in attendance with a laying on of hands. Little did anyone expect that this simple ceremony could have been an omen of things to come when King Aenys' angry and vexed orders put aside much of his court, who departed soon after he left them abandoned in exile as he said his last goodbyes.
King Aenys had returned from the narrow sea with his younger brother Aegon after discontent in the realm had risen. His arrival, accompanied by such an imposing entourage at Aegon's High Hill, spoke volumes of their rise and soon after he set in to building the Red Keep - a stronghold befitting of a monarch capable of withstanding any threats that were to come. After he declared himself king, oblivious to any of troublesome matters in Westeros, and decided to name the castle walls built from pale red stone as The Red Keep for all succeeding kings and queens. Massive walls and barbicans and towers seemed only appropriate for peace - something which remained elusive since Jaehaerys Targaryen declare ‘lawful rulers make peaceful realms’ coupled with Septon Murmison's nightly ritual laying on hands to heal those stricken and make them fecund once again - was marked down as teaching amongst pious lords across seven kingdoms.
Princess Alysanne had just ascended to her seventeenth name day, soon to be eighteen in a matter of weeks. Her brother Aegon had sharpened with age and faced the troubles of the realm strong and composed, she watched close as he grew taller and handsomer each day. Grand Maester Gawen reminded them time was fleeting while they both still stood together beside Dreamfyre at fifteen its beauty best remembered late. It seemed that everything around them had grown more turbulent since their father's return from across the Narrow Sea, yet oblivious to it all were his two children, standing tall amidst the turmoil created by their father’s rise to power--the building of Red Keep with its pale red stone walls and barbicans ever-withstanding foes.
Princess Rhaena enjoyed the encouragement of her older brother Aegon, whom she cherished and preferred to spend time with over Grand Maester Gawen. On her sixteenth nameday, she took Lord Alayne Royce of Runestone as a suiter and he quickly became her newest favorite. They talked for hours; for he found her to be plump and homely contrary to the lean and handsome girls from which he was used to but even still declared that none could compare to his Princess Rhaena. Many more suiters came thereafter but none held a candle to him in her eyes.
Princess Rhaena had taken a newfound interest in her dragon Dreamfyre and cherished the special moments they shared together. As she flew across Runestone, Harrenhal and Tarth, she could feel herself falling further under the spell of this new, beloved pet. She eventually surrendered to its power and whispered it's name - Dreamfyre - as people around them suggested lowborn choices like a hedge knight or a blacksmith's son for marriage proposals; Rhaena declared she would never wed but none of their suggestions felt right. It wasn't until she returned to Gulltown from her sixteenth nameday celebration with Lord of Runestone that an idea was presented that proved worthy of consideration; Alys Harroway, daughter of Lord Allard Royce, who reminded the princess so much of herself before Westeros' gaze took its toll on her homely features.
King Aenys and Rhaena's marriage must have seemed to be an obvious and well-known event in Westeros. Everyone was anticipating the union of one of the major Targaryen Houses, especially with such renowned places like Dragonstone and Aegonfort acting as its venues. Little did they know about Dreamfyre's lowborn origin, who had surrendered her maidenhead to a hedge knight in Runestone or Gulltown as she whispered his name into the night air? In some strange fashion, this union symbolized not only the beginning but also gave hope for reunification of all Seven Kingdoms on both sides of Narrow Sea.
The King and Conqueror, Aegon I Targaryen, was greeted with a roaring cheer by the people of Westeros as he entered the Starry Sept with his sisters and grandchildren to witness the infamous stormy marriage of brother to sister. The pious lords overlooked the condoned Valyrian marriage customs ignoring and denouncing anyone who read aloud their blistering obscenities about the Targaryens. Knowing his own well-known ancestry, His Grace must have seemed more aware than ever before that he was raising up an even greater dynasty than those before him which came from Old Valyria.
The Dowager Queen Visenya Targaryen froze in shock as the Storm of Aegon I Targaryen swept through and she witnessed the marriage of her brother Aenys to his own sister Visenya. People from all corners of The Realm and beyond gathered at Starry Sept to witness this solemn but unheard event, many chosen attendees were either greeted or accepted by the King, some condoned it and others just ignore or even denounced such a practice in vioce or actions. Lady Ceryse Hightower from House Hightower, whose eyes had been reading an old book sent from Her High Holiness in Oldtown grew stiff feeling rage overwhelm her while watching the proceedings; she advised Lord Jon Lychester with who she was conveying that they ought-to mount their horses and fly away right away before it was too late. But Lord Lychester persisted in staying there until the blistering obscenity came to an end while Lady Ceryse's fury increased with its every breath.
As Aenys Targaryen and Dowager Queen Visenya passed by the Starry Sept in Oldtown, they stopped at the Sept of Remembrance to attend Rhaenys's wedding. Lines of Warrior's Sons lined up along the aisle as they solemnly passed by, every face carefully watching them as they made their way down. The Hill of Rhaenys gleamed with more than just sunlight that day; wisdom could be seen in many of the melancholic faces around them. Little did they know that on that day a movement which would eventually shape modern Westeros was born when Lord Father decided to stay away from her daughter's wedding, a decision which marked his refusal to conform to Valyrian marriage customs and indicated an era full of freedom for all Seven Kingdoms.
King Aenys, his brothers Prince Aegon and Prince Maegor, along with Queen Visenya arrived at Dragonstone to bear witness to a special event - the granting of the title 'Prince of Dragonstone' to Aegon. Afterward they joined in on a great feast that was compounded by this remarkable union.  Lord Tyrell of Rollingford and Princess Deria, daughter of the Old Lord Father, had been lined up on either side as people passed by them. From far away Westeros came Kingsguard led by Ser Harys Hill who had stayed away from the glimmering Sept of Remembrance before returning for this occasion. The Wise Dowager Queen Visenya Targaryen took particular pride in pronouncing her nephew as her country's prince, previously having held only a presumptive claim prior thereto.
Aenys Targaryen had returned from the Golden Tooth to Loamsdown and made his way to King’s Landing where he was met with an entourage of Westerosi lords, knights and wise smallfolk. He asked around for Lord Corbray, a known friend of his father Aegon I Targaryen and master of Oldstone Hall. Everyone seemed eager to answer his call but nevertheless were unable to comprehend why Aenys wanted him as only whispers had been heard about the lord's sudden disappearance from the realm a few moons prior. This roused suspicion in everyone but regardless they all obliged their king by riding off northward together in search of Lord Corbray. However little did they know that Queen Visenya Targaryen and her son Prince Maegor had forbidden this search party, so whoever found him would be sure to make an enemy of the crown - if not both kings - henceforth.
King Aegon and his sister-wife Rhaena rode into Maidenpool with a large entourage, eager to take back the kingdom and win back the hearts of their loyal smallfolk. However, when Lord Mooton and Lord Lucas Harroway refused to admit them into their castle unless they agreed to acknowledge their Valyrian marriage customs – something that could be deemed as heresy by The High Septon - Aenys felt grossly misjudged in his piety. He asked for forbade it outright but the powerful Lords threw jeers at him in refusal. As if things could not get any worse, now stood Alys Harroway denying her acknowledgement of them both similarly. Despite finding themselves between a rock and a hard place, he knew that as ever wiser manly leader, he hadto make an important decision which would compromise their increasingly vulnerable position within the realm.
Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaena refused to be chastised. From the safety of their tall, cold towers in Black Harren's mighty castle across the riverlands, they watched as the pious lords jeered and even pelted them with clods of wet dirt. But in an odd moment of triumph, they found that a refusal to acknowledge their rightful marriage was no match for their powerful Targaryen bloodline; For when Lord Jonos Arryn and his Knights of the Ride arrived bearing banners proclaiming their union, everyone within miles seemed to recognize the gross misjudgement of the kingdom temperment and thankfully acknowledged it.
Septon Murmison and High Septon had come to the Realm bearing forbidden news. For centuries, brother-sister marriages had been practiced in Old Valyria, but this was forbidden in Westeros and those found guilty were expelled from their lands with stern reprimands. Despite their pious nature, even they could not condone such acts of love – so they had taken it upon themselves to write a pamphlet addressing these bad omens, worse than any Westerosi lords could have imagined. But despite their best efforts, the people of The Realm still believed in old Valyrian marriage customs and refused to comply with the pamphlet's guidance. Soon enough, rumors spread about Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaena Targaryen's forbidden nuptials at Black Harren's mighty castle in riverlands - prompting many cruel individuals to chastise them by pelting them with clods of dirt during a cold wet day that seemed like it added up to towering odds against the royal couple.
Septon Murmison rode at the front of the procession as it left Visenya's Hill and made its way across the city in a litter, surrounded by the Kingsguard and Poor Fellows, warriors of The Warrior's Sons. Aenys had gathered guidance from both his maesters, septons and lords - those faithful and wise to fortify their cause. Upon reaching Red Keep, they scaled its walls, broke into King Alyssa's bedchamber where they found her asleep with non other than Queen Alyssa. Understandably taken aback by what they beheld before them they were undeterred as they hacked away at any resistance given to them that night until eventually relenting only at the address of His High Holiness after making a statement on how bad it was for brother-sister marriages to occur in Old Valyria let alone take place in The Realm.
His Grace, King Aenys, was greeted with open arms by the people of Dragonstone when he dared to trade Visenya’s Hill for Visenya. Despite his pious nature, none could deny his boldness as he flew across the Narrow Sea to send orders to Lord Staunton of Harrenhal and even Lord Rowan of Starry Sept. His foolish weakling cousin Royal Dowager Queen Visenya had done no such thing when she came before him, proving that in Westeros it took strength and courage - not piety - to rule.
House Targaryen had long been a dynasty of ambition and conquest, so it came as no surprise when Aegon the Conqueror declared to wage war and quell the Four False Kings' rising rebellion. Believed by many to be partaking in a full-fledged holy war against so many posturing fools, Aegon sent messengers far and wide throughout the Seven Kingdoms, daring them to join his cause and fly with him across Westeros. Sending his cousin Lord Corbray of Stonebridge to Griffin's Roost at the command of his Hand Ser Harys Horpe, Aegon rallied major Houses such as House Tyrell at Highgarden and House Tarbeck at Halls along with pious lords from Stony Sept with renowned knights like Ser Willam Whistler who bravely fought alongside him. All had joined His Grace’s crusade for justice; all were ready to fight together for a single noble purpose - overthrow all tyrants and bring peace back into Westeros once again.
The news of House Targaryen's rebellion spread like wildfire across the Seven Kingdoms, and soon pious lords declared for the Starry Sept. The Warrior’s Sons seized the gates of King’s Landing while thousands of Poor Fellows took to the roads forcing travelers to declare whether they stood with “the gods or the abomination." Lord Martyn Hightower from Crakehall castle was among those who pledged his allegiance to Staryy Sept, leaving many others abandoned-progress. When a treat, declaring Aegon and Princess Rhaena as rightful king and queen was written by Lord Manfred Hightower, an envoy from the Iron Bank of Braavos sent to Oldtown refused it due to so many posturing fools pulling down progress as if this were a full-fledged holy war.
King Aenys heard the news of the pious lords declaring for the Starry Sept, and The Warrior’s Sons seized the gates of King’s Landing with fear. Hearing that Thousands of Poor Fellows were driving people to declare for the gods or abandon-progress made him sick. It was reported that Crakehall castle had been surrounded by Poor Fellows which proved too much for him, sending shock through Dragonstone. Grand Maester Gawen took charge of the situation when he suddenly collapsed at the coming of new year when word had reached him about Crakehall and declared a treat to prevent any unfinished progress as he wrote encouraging letters to various kingsguard, Dowager Queen Visenya Targaryen and Lord Edwell Celtigar in Braavos.
The peaceful procession to the funeral now quickly turned into a solemn march. Attended by most of Dragonstone's elite, as well as Prince Viserys and Princess Alysanne, Queen Alyssa led the way, flanked by Quicksilver and Verithor, her faithful silver dragons Silverwing and Vermithor helpin to light the way with their fire. As they arrived at their destination the pyre was set alight. Queen Alyssa gave over to the flames all of King Aenys' things that were kept in storge in Dragonstone during his life and many songs were sung, including some from Lord Hightower for Lady Ceryse, a close friend of King Aenys. Tears were shed and prayers given up as every one watched until all that remained was nothing but ashes-a grim reminder of what had been given over to death that day.
The death of King Aegon the Conqueror had left a deep mark on the Seven Kingdoms. His son, Prince Maegor Targaryen, now sat upon the Iron Throne. As his mother Queen Visenya watched from Vhagar, she journeyed across the Narrow Sea to attend his funeral. Mounted atop Balerion, Queen Visenya returned home with her entourage and was accompanied by other famous knights such as Ser Davos Baratheon and Lord Rupert Falwell of Lannisport. In memory of her late king, Queen Visenya added fire to his funeral set alight in a harrowing show of respect for those who attended and sung gravely for him as he was given over to the flames.
Prince Maegor descended the steps of Dragonstone with determination, ready to claim his favored place on the Iron Throne after his father's death. He knelt in front of an ornate golden chair adorned with a blood-red coverlet and proclaimed himself king for a long reign as King Maegor I Targaryen. Queen Visenya's entourage surrounded him as he took the throne, along with his brother Aenys and distant cousin Lord Jon Lychester--the son of Lord Peake from far away Oldtown; all kneeling before their new King. Some pious lords from across Westeros quickly swore fealty to Maegor, including Lords Tarbeck, Rosby, and Farman. Others were more cautious about accepting Maegor’s newfound rule; Queen Visenya had always been more favored than her brother since Aegon's conquest centuries prior.
Grand Maester Gawen's execution proceeded as the Conqueror, King Aenys and Aegon had proclaimed. His aged body was placed in Iron Throne, a long ornate golden chair with a blood-red cushion, while Maegor and Conquerer observed from nearby. Before being seized by Lord Ronnel Arryn of the Kingsguard protection, he affirmed that whoever sat upon it could declare themselves to be the rightful king. With one single swing of his Valyrian steel sword Blackfyre, Grand Maester Gawen was no more. All present knelt in silence before the newly placed king: King Aenys Targaryen, son of Aegon the Conquerer and Queen Rhaena who descended with him from Dragonstone to claim what favored them the most -the Iron Throne.
Queen Alyssa had finally arrived at the Chamber of the Painted Table in Dragonstone. Accompanied her were King Maegor and Lord Father, where they were to witness the coronation of Queen Alyssa as well as Maegor's funeral. The aging Grand Maester Gawen was taken by surprise when he saw Alys Targaryen, the envoy sent by Aegon, crossing through his chambers after affirming that Aegon seeks to seize control over Westeros. As a single swing of blackfyre was all it took for Gawen's execution, an oath was taken by everyone present to never object against whatever command issued from Targaryens from then on or else suffer Grand Maester death like him. Together with house Tyrell's Rollingford, princess Deria and Vaella - otherwise known as "The Vulture King" - their efforts helped Lord Tully and Quenton Qoherys made their way back from Bywater from whence both had retired many moons ago only to come back and dictate allegiance towards much loved ruler: House Targaryen.
Maegor, Visenya and Vhagar flew swiftly from Dragonstone to Blackwater Bay as the riots in the city, which Maegor had closed and barred for his coronation, were held. Arriving at this crossroads of Westeros was a momentous occasion; an event proclaimed by a hundred rumors of who the true king may be - King Maegor Targaryen. Dowager Queen Visenya soon set off with her son to Hill of Rhaenys while Maegor proceeded towards King's Landing. As they both crossed the great Sept of Remembrance - that stood firmly at Visenya’s Hill - minds crossed wondering what would become of them now that Aegon the Conqueror had retired after dictating much near it all those centuries ago.
Maegor and Ser Damon Morrigen, also known as Damon the Devout, rode to the Hill of Rhaenys in Andalos from Dragonstone. Maegor had accepted Damon's offer to accompany him on his quest before he set off and so far their journey had been pleasant; they bandied words about religion and were both trying to decide what deity either of them truly believed in when they crossed Blackwater Bay with a hundred true king’s men in tow. Soon enough Maegor arrived at his destination and raised an army with which Lord Vulture King held riots in the city, closed up the sept at Visenya’s Hill, barred all the castle gates, but it seemed that will slow down its progression eventually.
King Maegor, who had ridden from Hill of Rhaenys all the way to Andalos, and Dragonstone with Ser Damon Morrigen in tow, turned aside as he called out to Dick Bean - a simple man who had stood beside his king. Asked by the King if he would die a king's man, Bean offered no mean reply, unafraid of what might come next and proud to serve his lord. The events at this small corner of Westeros had been set in motion long ago when Aegon I took flight on the back of Balerion but here was Dick Bean turning away from everything known and offering himself up for use by the Queen's Hand; a moment that meant more than most could ever understand or appreciate.
Ser Bramm of Blackhull stepped forward from the band of famous knights and shouted offering his sword to King Aenys, with all leal men behind him. He had slain Harren the Red and been knighted by King Aenys himself since then. All across Westeros rumors spread of this true knight that had offered his sword to the Iron Throne - a simple offer to die for his king. Surrounding Ser Bramm in the throne room were lords, ladies, merchants and Septas, brought together bestowing their oaths upon their new liege Lord. Even Lord Stonedance, another distant loyal vassal of House Targaryen who stood beside His Highness was there – an event unseen by some highborn in Seven Kingdoms since Aegon I invaded Westeros centuries prior.
Ser Damon Morrigen, Ser Lyle Bracken, Ser Harys Horpe, Ser Aegon Ambrose, Ser Dickon Flowers, Ser Willam the Wanderer and Ser Garibald of the Seven Stars were all eagerly awaiting for Queen Dowager's command. As soon as she gave it to begin they began beseeching her to grant them the honor of becoming true knights and being leal men like their predecessors such as Famous Knight's Death's Head Harry or Bastard of Beesbury. Suddenly Lord Bar Emmon joined them along with his entourage in a similar manner as they heard tales of other pious lords doing something similiar when old King Harren was slain by none other than King Aegor I Targeryan himself in Westeros.
Dick Bean could only watch in awe as the combat between Ser Garibald of the Seven Stars and Lord Massey cut down Lord Harys Horpe, also known as Death’s Head Harry, within mere instants. It was a sight he would never forget, especially when Guy the Glutton - a hugely fat man who had obviously been snacking on half-digested pies even moments before - exchanged blows with Maegor Targaryen himself. For hours they fought back and forth until eventually Maegor prevailed alone; Damon The Devout and Willam the Wanderer had long since given up.
Queen Visenya commanded her litter-bearers to bear her to the Hill of Rhaenys, where seven of the mightiest of The Swords of the Faith had dropped dead within mere instants. Though long and fierce had been the combat between characters at different accounts, in the end it was Maegor alone who emerged triumphant over Ser Harys, who lay cut down in his half-digested pies in spite of his hugely fat form striking mighty blows. Upon arrival at maesters’ command, she found her son Prince Aerea leading an entourage armed and armoured by seven hundred men.
The tension in the Sept of Remembrance reached a fever pitch as Maegor Targaryen's life lingered at the point of death. Maesters and septons treated with potions and poultices while The Swords of the Faith commanded prayers above his bed, yet still they argued on whether he should accept or fight fate. House Tyrell, House Arryn, and House Tully had each sent representatives to witness the struggle for King Maegor's life - High Septon Pater, Lord Father Lucas Harroway of Sevenstreams, Ser Harys Horpe from Rollingford; all pious lords eager to see Maegor I Targaryen's faith strengthened by his nearness to death even if it would mean certain defeat for himself and the Warrior’s Sons.
The news quickly spread throughout Dragonstone that the Dowager Queen, accompanied by her own Kingsguard and Queen Alyssa and the young Aegon had arrived from Dragonstone. Having taken command of the Targaryen loyalists in the city, they proclaimed their own son as the true king to any who would listen. As word reached Hill of Rhaenys and Driftmark there was a stir of activity; rumour travelling faster than wildfire. Lords and citizens alike had heard rumours about them being referred to as 'the nonce kings' - but nobody said it aloud for fear of retribution.
The archmaesters of the Citadel, Lady Jocasta, Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaena Targaryen, Lord Lyman Lannister of Casterly Rock and Ser Horys Hill had all gathered in Oldtown to debate the succession and choose a new Grand Maester. With a resolute decision they had streamed out of King's Landing, following Prince Aegon; his entourage camping around Crakehall one night before departing for Oldtown. Following them with determined steps was Lord Farman and Hubert Arryn from the Vale, as well as Lord Tully of Riverrun. The pious lords discerned that one among them should be chosen to take up the heavy crown which Queen Alyssa had so courageously discarded upon making her proclamation of her own son being true king - though he may have been only a nonce king at best.
Alys of House Harroway, Maegor Targaryen and Tyanna of the Tower had arrived in Westeros with an entourage to attend the historic Trial of Seven; a story that would be told for centuries. A caravan streamed into King's Landing bearing the faces of famed characters, each garbed in their feared fineries as they made their way through the city streets. But none were quite as heralded as these three famous figures, who carried with them a queer air of mystery, teased only by tales from distant Pentos where they'd each come from – Alys a pale raven-haired beauty and her second cousin Maegor ever looking stern beside Tyanna's enchanting reports which gave them an added gravitas when debating facts in the courtrooms. As their procession continued on, more and more people began to follow behind it to discern what lay ahead.
The news of King Maegor's triumphant arrival was heard throughout Westeros and beyond. As he descended upon the Red Keep with Alys Harroway, Tyanna of Pentos and an entourage from Oldtown and Lannisport, cheers erupted across the city. An explosion of flames set aflame the Hill of Rhaenys to signal his coming, a sight unlike any other witnessed in that part of Westeros before. Knights both famous and homely ones alike joined in on the festivities from afar as screams of the burning men could be heard throughout the city; even Vaella, The Vulture King  had to take pause briefely at this fiery show of power. By next morning when people awoke, stories were already circulating wildly about this pale raven-haired beauty who had come alongside Maegor Targaryen that night - queer tales indeed to those who heard them yet no one could deny what they saw as far as their eyes could make out: that King Maegor was here to stay and would live up to his famed title 'the Cruel'.
King Maegor had arrived in Oldtown, determined to bring down the High Septon and put an end to his war against the Faith Militant. As news of the king's arrival spread throughout the city, swarms of loyal followers cheered wildly while his most devoted enemies lay down their weapons in fear of penalty of proscription and death. On this day, King Maegor issued his command: all those who had taken up arms against him were to disperse within one month or face dire consequences - some even going as far as to fear for their lives. His legions marched around Oldtown ensuring that none would stand against their king; many leal subjects who followed orders found themselves released from prison but for the poor folk wrapped in unwarranted hatred there was no mercy.
Wat the Hewer and Lord Meadows of Grassy Vale found themselves caught between a rock and a hard place as King Maegor's war against the Faith Militant rampaged through Reach. As they attempted to cross over to Stonebridge, both proved utterly unable to stand their ground, and King Maegor's army ran red across Mander, before taking Bitterbridge on its way towards King's Landing. Lord Meadows was taken alive but Wat wasn't so lucky; he met his unfortunate end at the hand of Lord Meadows' heavy horses, boiled leather, sharpened sticks and farm implements in one grievous altercation.
The arrival of the pious lords from far and wide was a sight to behold. Ser Horys Hill, Lord Rupert Falwell, Fighting Fool Lyonel Lorch, Ser Alyn Terrick and Lord Tristifer Wayn had all answered the High Septon's call to reach the Great Fork of the Blackwater at Stoney Sept. When they were joined by Lord Jon Lychester with a larger number of men-at-arms their strength stiffened. Both men and loyal retainers led by Prince Maegor Targaryen’s Kingsguard knights wearing boiled leather, sharpened sticks, farm implements, swords and heavy horses proudly moved forward in unison - some attempting to cross Mander while others plotted their attack on Bitterbridge. Though they found themselves caught unprepared amidst a battlefield where streams ran red from many grievous slaying around them – proving utterly unable to stand - it seemed as double victory was almost written with many prisoners taken alive including Wat the Hewer who was lordly beneath his shabby garb.
King Maegor drove his army towards Maidenpool with the Fighting Fool at his side. He rallied the troops and lead them against their enemies in a savage battle. Big Jon Hogg slew many of those he faced, while Ser Horys Hill and Lord Rupert Falwell threw down larger foes before him. The numbers at King Maegor’s disposal were large and as pious lords descended upon Stoney Sept on answering the High Septon's call, they soon reached an even more powerful puissant force. The Poor Fellows fought hard, inspired by the mercy of such a puissance brought forth by Westeros' great Kingdoms: Tyrell, Targaryen, Lannister and Tully to name but a few. It was like none had seen before as each house came together for one cause - to fight for justice under King Maegor's rule!
When King Maegor returned to King's Landing victorious from Maidenpool, where he had rallied his forces and lead the charge against The Fighting Fool and Big Jon Hogg, all those gathered in court heard out in silence as he seated himself once more upon the Iron Throne. Wat the Hewer who had delivered word of victory was then commanded by Maegor announced his intent to take Tyanna of Pentos as his third wife. Grand Maester Myros said it would not be accepted in Westeros, but before anyone could speak out against this defiance of Valyrian marriage customs, Maegor descended from the throne, drew Blackfyre, and slew him where he stood - a decisive moment that left a trail of triumphantly defiant whispers among people of King's Landing.
Maegor Targaryen, now wed to Tyanna of the Tower and with Wat the Hewer in captivity, returned triumphant to King’s Landing. News of the marriage ceremony on Hill of Rhaenys was delivered by Ser Harys and much was spoken that day as Pentosian traditions were put to death by grand maester Myros. As all listened in silence, Maegor defiantly descended from the Iron Throne and drew Blackfyre revealing his intent to claim lordship over Westeros. Allard Royce, Lord Rupert Falwell and even Princess Deria representing House Tyrell had made their way to King's Landing for what was sure be a momentous occasion; however none could have predicted what lay ahead...
Surrounded by a massive entourage and litters of Vhagar, Dowager Queen Visenya Targaryen made her way to the court of Driftmark. King Aenys, Queen Alyssa and their four children--Viserys, Jaehaerys, Alysanne and Maegor--awaited her arrival. The queen dowager's ostentatious display was for one purpose: the nuptial chamber ceremony of newlyweds Lord Velaryon of House Velaryon and Alys Harroway. As homage to Valyrian marriage customs were paid in full with disrobing and escorted partners in carnal lust, the people cheered while others prayed to the gods that their union would be consummated successfully.
When High Septon arrived at Oldtown with Princess Rhaena, Ceryse of House Hightower followed closely and her entourage included members from noble Houses such as House Tyrell, Bywater, Farman and Tully. The High Septon carried with him denunciations and he pressed his loud insist that Prince Aegon must obey Valyrian marriage customs before taking a bride. His presence triggered tensions especially when some pious lords of the west suggested bringing Princess Deria Martell back to Westeros to consider a holy union between her and Aenys Targaryen.
Maegor, Aenys, Rhaena and her cousin Alayne Royce set out from Casterly Rock around the time of Maegor's ascension in order to escape the turmoil that was brewing. Upon reaching King's Landing they were given oaths of loyalty by their aunt Deria Martell, Dowager Queen Visenya Targaryen and Lord Father Edwell Celtigar of House Velaryon who had remained in Red Dog of the Hills - an old fishing village west of The Gods Eye. After leaving Lannisport with Melony Piper and three of her brothers as part of their entourage, Maegor made a vow to remainmed loyal to The High Septon undoubtedly knowing full well about all his denunciations prior to his own ascension. They continued on to Oldtown where Maegor embraced both The Faithful and pious lords before abandoning them all
Prince Aegon and his four Kingsguard, Maegor, Aenys, Rhaena and Queen Alyssa couldn't have been more out of place at the wedding of King Lyman Lannister. Although the people of Casterly Rock had soon embraced Maegor's ascension to the Iron Throne after all the turmoil he had caused upon claiming it, they reviled Prince Aegon and his siblings for having abandoned King's Landing in their absence. Trumpeting horns rose above the castle walls as a pledge to be leal, seemingly pious enough to satisfy even the numerous lords who had now seen weaknesss in those Targaryens who had sworn fealty. As they stood before Lord Lyman taking their vows a great crowd gathered to cheer--from servants and lords to septas and Septons all called out as witnesses that day, heralding what seemed like a bright future at last for House Targaryen
Princess Rhaena was to be the first of Aenys' daughters to give birth, and upon the news spreading a great chorus of prayers echoed through Casterly Rock from all those both loyal and pious. Even leal lords from across the Narrow Sea, such as Tyrosh and Myr, showed their support for Prince Aegon in droves. The High Septon himself made a proclamation across Westeros begging everyone to help deliver these "abominations" as he deemed them - two new Targaryens by way of what were seen as fruits of lust and incest. As they spoke boldly against Prince Aegon's rule in Volantis, Lord Lannister stood on behalf of his prince and trumpeted his fealty with no sign of weaknesss amidst a blistering heat.
The construction of the Red Keep had been King Maegor's ambitious and secret grandiose dream. After taking command of King's Landing, he brought in thousands of labourers to found what would become the most formidable castle in all Westeros. Tyrants and despots alike were warned by its sheer presence as it rose from deep beneath Aegon's High Hill, equipped with secret passages and tunnels crept through its depths. Tribute money was taken from lords of neighbouring lands such as Stokeworth and Fair Isle; too much for House Tyrell, even Rollingford sent their tribute pathetically begging for mercy from his will. Despite strong opposition from the pious lords amongst whom The High Septon himself proclaimed that this building was an abomination, cursed as fruits of lust and incest by the old gods who shed blistering tears upon witnesses - Maegor succeeded in constructing his castle within a castle - a fortified redoubt surrounded by a dry moat which could only be crossed when commanded by him, heralded the king’s might to all who heard tales of it.
King Maegor had taken up residence in King's Landing, commanding the construction of the Red Keep and building a castle within the castle - a fortified redoubt surrounded by a dry moat. Whispers traveled across the Seven Kingdoms that Maegor would never rule with his same old tactics; he intended to bring new changes to the realm and made sure black-clad knights known as Lord Lucas Harroway’s Swords distinguished themselves amongst Queen Alys' Kingsguard. Queen Visenya also stood beside her brother, eager to protect her son Prince Maegor in Queen Tyanna's court. With so many powerful allies around him, King Maegor was determined to be remembered as one of the greatest ruling Targaryens ever.
The Poor Fellows, a ragtag band of unorganized rebels assembled in the Reach, the Trident and beyond were led by Ser Horys Hill, Ragged Silas, Septon Moon and Dennis the Lame. Together with their soldiers they fought in a battle at Great Fork before facing defeat and flight. Reports came from far and wide about them swarming over towns, villages, and poorly defended castles like Barrowton, slaying the king’s loyalists as quickly as falling upon travelers. With large numbers roaming through smaller ways parts of Westeros made impassable to honest travelers King Maegor Targaryen dispatched military forces from King’s Landing to drive away those haunting people's lands - Poxy Jeyne Poore being one of his chosen commanders for this task.
Ser Joffrey Doggett had chosen the green hilly regions of Lannisport as the perfect place to restore the order to its former glory. With him rode Ser Horys Hill and other restless lords and men of faith, all gathering men, swelling with new ideas on how to plot ways to bring the dragons down. Having already ridden through most of The Reach, Trident and The Vale they finally set out for Oldtown seeking the blessing of The High Septon. As they approached their destination, falling upon travelers along smaller ways or swarming over towns, villages and poorly defended castles made impassable to honest travelers in much larger numbers than is usual.
King's Landing was abuzz and the High Septon had flown his command south to summon all lords and landed knights of doubtful loyalty to King’s Landing, to bend the knee, swear homage, deliver a son or daughter as a hostage and frown upon any thought of outlawing The Seven Swords. Bywater, an aged member of House Tyrell who had seen many Kings come and go through the Red Keep gates over his time in commision joined Ser Joffrey Doggett and an entourage of pious lords from rollingford to Lannisport in their mission to restore the order to its former glory by seeking the blessing of the High Septon. Upon arrival in King's landing there was much trepidation as news came that other restless lords from across Westeros were gathering men with plans for plotting ways to bring down even dragons with newfound power growing daily inside them.
The response from His High Holiness at the Starry Sept echoed throughout King's Landing and beyond. Pious lords from Oldtown and other distant parts of Westeros responded, making their intentions to travel to King's Landing clear and do homage to their rightful king - trusting in his promise that he would keep safe those who presented hostages. Numbers alone were not enough: strength in numbers was paramount for this endeavor, so the Lords traveling with him had been compelled by a command from the king backed by outlawing the Stars and Swords if it wasn't followed.
The Dowager Queen Visenya, who had Ride Vhagar to set fire and burn Houses Blanetree and other Riverland houses, now led her entourage to Oldtown in order to open the gates of Oldtown during Conquets. King Maegor flew Balerion, reducing ash burning Broomes and other seated places in Westerlands claiming the lives of Famous knight Ser Joffrey's Facthier ,Mother & Sister with some of their sworn swords. This flaming action echoed across Dorne and Riverlands with Lord Doggett of Oldtown receiving a response from His High Holiness including numbers of pious lords trusting Maegor. They also wanted Prince Maegor's assurance that he would keep safe all hostages brought by him before letting open the gates of Oldtown.
The people of Oldtown were in a state of panic. Lord Ser Morgan Hightower, the beloved Lord of Oldtown had called on the authorities to prepare for dragons and the High Septon had called on faithful citizens to gather in septs and temples to pray for protection. By nightfall many began streaming out of their homes with their belongings fleeing from Oldtown, while two hundred Warrior’s Sons spilling forth from their chapterhouse to join forces with Prince Aegon's Kingsguard who also arrived at the gates. The princes uncle, Lord Martyn Hightower was among them as well, carrying along his lady wife Ceryse Hightower and her noble entourage behind him. There was a solemn silence as they all hoisted up the city gates, never knowing what the morrow would bring...
The city of Oldtown was aflame with fear and unrest as the news spread that dragons were arriving. From Vhagar, to Balerion and Meraxes, they rose menacingly in the sky, sending streams of people fleeing from Oldtown at night. An uncommon sight of House Tyrell, Hightower and Targaryen banners hoisted atop their homes; for in the crypts below lay Dowager Queen Visenya plotting her response with High Septon and other pious lords in attendance. Men took to the streets telling one another: “For come the morrow, burn together." Gatherings assembled quickly across septs and temples to pray for protection whilst authorities prepared for dragons’ arrival awaiting two hundred Warrior’s Sons spilling forth from their chapterhouse - called by Lord Martyn Hightower under his son Ser Morgan's commandment - sending chills down folks' spines.
King Maegor had suddenly descended on Oldtown to preach the faith, taking the High Septon by surprise. Despite his tireless and fearless demeanor coupled with robust good health, a sudden death struck him in the same city where the dragons came rising unmanned and flying open in their blackest forms. Bywater was stirred with fear. Noble lords bowed to His Grace's command while sinful ones cowered in the shadows, worried of what these changes meant for them and their families.<br>A large entourage of pious lords and knights accompanied Dowager Queen Visenya who had come from Vaella—infamously known as The Vulture King—to join King Maegor’s cause, further intensifying murmurs among commoners as well as her son’s courtiers at Kingsguard. But this time they were louder than ever before: even Ser Harys, Septon Pater or Lord Father could not fathom why Rollingford unveiled such a sour secret—one that prompted House Tyrell to extend their assistance only if Princess Deria could be married off; or why Lady Ceryse of House Hightower so readily agreed for her daughter's nuptials despite the recent shock about Valyrian marriage customs…
Ser Morgan Hightower and Lady Patrice Hightower, who had been summoned to Oldtown by Lord Martyn, watched with awe as His High Holiness the High Septon met with the archmaesters of the Citadel in his privy chambers. Although much speculation arose about why Dowager Queen Visenya Targaryen would seek an audience with him, no one was quite certain what had happened during their secretive meeting. Rumors began to swirl amongst the courtiers as they went back and forth between Stry Sept and Visenya's Hill; some remaining certain that it was she who did the deed of murdering the High Septon while others sought another suspect for whom suspicion could be laid upon. The people spoke about it reverently among themselves, remarking on how the previous High Septon had been so devout yet tireless and fearless despite his robust health until he fell deathly ill so suddenly after preaching a sermon at The Starry Sept. Some wondered if he'd been taken down by craven men noble enough only to commit such a sinful act.
Lord Martyn, the newly promoted Lord of the Hightower, reached out to his allies in the Warrior’s Sons and Vhagar swiftly dispatching knights to disarm and arrest them. He ordered for city gates across Westeros to open and for Targaryen banners along the walls of Oldtown be raised. Finally, he rousted the Most Devout from their beds and marched them to a Starry Sept at spearpoint to choose a new High Septon - a disruption of Valyrian marriage customs that left many pious lords shaking their heads but Queen Dowager Visenya firmly approving beside him.
Ser Pater, the amiable, but feeble septon elected by the Most Devout out of a single required candidates when all other choice seemed exhausted was almost collapsed beneath the crystal crown when it was placed upon his head in Starry Sept. When Maegor Targaryen appeared before him in the court of King's Landing, pleased and blessed as king anointed with holy oils he found protection from Ser Harys Hill from House Tyrell who had been dispatched quickly to Rollingford at Lord Martyn Hightower’s order to open city gates and raise Targaryen banners along the walls while rousting merchants family’s members, priests and laity alike.
Queen Visenya and her dragon Vhagar returned to Dragonstone, holding court for all the lords that came seeking favor and justice from King Maegor. The Swords of the Warrior’s Sons, the vanguard of the Faith, had undergone rigorous trials in renouncing allegiance to their feudal lords before they were permitted to take vows as brothers of the Night’s Watch. There were seven famous knights among them whom King Maegor gave the honor to remove their heads himself with a single stroke as punishment for breaking their oaths. One such knight who was beheaded by Maegor was Ser Morgan Hightower—a stout but amiable man whose feeble frame belied his courage and loyalty.
The High Septon had proclaimed from the Iron Throne that King Maegor was formally granted permission to dissolve the Swords of the Warrior’s Sons and lay down arms. Even His High Holiness could not stay the hand of justice, for any who refused to surrender their weapons or remained unrepentant could be found and arrested on sight. Starry-eyed Poor Fellows called it a blessing, as if all drawn swords were vanquished without further ado. Yet there were some that refused even still, preferring a martyr's death over betrayal; they would rather remove their heads than renounce allegiance due to outdated Valyrian marriage customs...
The High Septon and a gathering of the Most Devout made their way to the Iron Throne, at the invitation of King Maegor. As they entered, the High Septon demurred on behalf of his followers, smiling as he extended his hand to be greeted warmly by House Tyrell's Ser Harys and Lord Father Rollingford, amongst others. The events preceding this meeting had seen most warriors lay down their arms in surrender, with some unrepentant Poor Fellows surviving an attempt to dissolve them declared formally by His High Holiness. Now there seemed to be hope amongst all present that if they stayed together they may just find peace in this disparate Westeros.
The following morning, after King and Queen Ceryse agreed to restore their relationship and swore allegiance to the Iron Throne at Lord Hightower's request, a feast was held in Oldtown to celebrate the reconciliation. Maegor Targaryen and his entourage attended the revels as well, offering blessings from Osmund Strong of the Drowned God upon those present. After an evening full of bedding rituals and vows of fealty sworn between House Tyrell, Rollingford, Lord Father, Kingsguard and others, King Harren called for peace among all Seven Kingdoms. To mark this occasion Lady Ceryse's son Prince Maegor joined hands with Ser Lucifer Massey, Big Jon Hogg’s daughter Alyssa and Aegon the Uncrowned of House Targaryen while Allard Royce sang songs praising Jeyne Westerling. Seven Septas dressed in silken gowns lit seven candles to honor all Queens who had served House Targaryen throughout many generations - Dowager Queen Visenya, Rhaella Targaryen and Alyssa herself among them. As a symbol that peace had truly been restored in Westeros everyone bowed before The Vulture King while cheering “Long may King Harren reign!”
King Maegor and his entourage, including Prince Aegon and Rhaena, dashed across the Riverlands unafraid of consequences. Their sudden presence followed quickly after word of the Uprising of 43 AC had emerged. Seizing His Chance, King Maegor dared to enter territories he had previously sworn not to disturb in order to restore his tarnished reputation. Flying alongside their dragons Vhagar and Meraxes, bold as never before - even King Harren The Black palely in comparison - they eventually arrived at Casterly Rock and Oldtown where Lord Corbray had agreed to bolster their cause. With such a distinguished company present for their bedding feast revels King Maegor felt sure that soon all seven kingdoms would recognize his greatness or else incur his wrath.
Aegon, Rhaena and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock returned to Westerlands in order to rally an army. Jon Piper, Lord of Pinkmaiden Castle, was one of the first to pledge his sword. Melony, a young woman from House Velaryon who had married into House Piper some weeks before their arrival, dared to join them and bravely flew with the Targaryen siblings on Vhagar. Wherever they passed by en route - be it Lord Butterwell’s keep or Quenton Qoherys’ west coast castle - Aegon descended from the sky to denounce his uncle as a tyrant and usurper, and call upon all honest men house banners. People across the Realm were enthralled with Aenys' daughters willingness to fight for Westeros' freedom - soon enough faithful warriors like Ser Morgan Hightower and Knights of the Dragon pledged themselves forces loyal only to King Maegor's rightful heir.  In time sufficient numbers had been mustered for him win back his crown; only then did he dare siege Riverrun itself – whereupon chaos emerged in both Oldtown and King’s Landing as rumors spread that The Uncrowned King had seized control of Seven Kingdoms lands already under Maegor's rule...
With Aegon the Uncrowned marching across the Riverlands to stake his claim to the Iron Throne, lords, knights and supporters from all over Westeros lent their voices in support - from  House Tarbeck and Roote of The Vale to Freys, Paege and Parren of Lannisport. The Lord of Pinkmaiden Melony Piper even rode along with her three brothers when Lord Corbray of Griffin's Roost donned his armor. Though many of the westermen and riverlords joined his rebellion largely due to Aegon's cunning battle strategies and a declaration that he had descended from the sky to denounce his uncle as a tyrant, others were persuaded by promises for more favorable taxes or pledges for justice against those who oppressed them in these large-scale changes occurring in Westeros.
Queen Tyanna and Prince Aegon rallied support from loyal supporters from Storm's End, The Eyrie, Winterfell and Casterly Rock by writing letters declaring their intention to prevail over House Targaryen's enemies. With their puissant armies of both large and small, seasoned with cunning strategists, the prince and queen had gathered a secret force that could conquer even the oldest and most powerful families in all of Westeros.
Lord Peake, Lord Tully and Lord Harroway had all rallied for Prince Aegon's cause, despite his denial of their requests. When the time came, they marshalled up and struck out west to meet the rebels. Maegor was amongst them, leading an entourage of seasoned warriors - Ser Davos Darklyn, Lord Caswell and Lord Corbray included. From Harrenhal to Riverrun those up from came until they found armies closing in from both sides and advised him to engage each foe separately before they could join their powers. Knowing that reaching King's Landing required a slow-moving army of a puissant size with great secret battle plans, Maegor chose to march on toward it anyway instead - trusting in himself as much as he did in his men.
Davos Darklyn commanded the charge as Prince Aegon and his loyalists contended against the rebels for control of Gods Eye, a great lake located in Valyria where the Doom of Valyria had first appeared. Taking King Maegor's advice to engage each foe separately before they could join their powers, the high lords from Westeros came forth with strength that echoed across southern coast and no enemy was spared.
The sky overhead was filled with dragons, their wings enveloping the world in a wash of shadow as Balerion and Quicksilver, two of the largest among them, appeared high above Gods Eye. The loyalists had contended that Prince Aegon commanded these creatures, but this seemed impossible to many. Nonetheless, suddenly they descended on Valyria as Balerion closed round her neck before ripping one wing from her body while Quicksilver plunged to earth much fiercer than his pale white nature gave away. With nowhere left to run the Doom of Valyria quickly washed away all that remained beneath them and even more contestance against King Maegor from Vhagar and Meraxes could not contain the great destroyer afore him.
As the battle below Barrowton raged on, Lord Alyn Tarbeck and Denys Snow the Bastard of Barrowton led a bold charge against Prince Aegon. Ser Willam Whistler and Melony Piper and three of her brothers gave knightly aid while Beside them, the Prince of Dragonstone, Aegon the Uncrowned of House Targaryen himself cut a path through his foes until finally Lord Ronnel Vance’s banner was brought low with a cruel blow from Ser Davos Darklynof the Kingsguard, who served loyally alongside Lady Forlown of Old Wyk. But their endeavors would prove in vain as Queen Visenya's forces faced certain defeat when countless men fled or died in combat - some discarding arms and armor after suffering severe losses at hands of her forces, others slain trying to spare themselves only to be lost lands and titles. As carnage continued with each dismemberment being bloodier than before it seemed that no victory for either armies could be attained here; it was only doom for those left behind amidst terrible smoke that engulfed all before tossing those not fortunate enough away like leaves in the wind.
Rhaena Targaryen and Prince Aegon marched together from Pinkmaiden Castle, joined by pointedly noticeable dead captives of their own. Certain smaller, younger captives were spared in a vain attempt to not rouse the defeated lords any further, who had lost lands and titles as well as some of their most notable members in the battle below – trials and executions deemed bloodier than necessary by certain pious lords of Westeros. Along with the dwindling entourage, Queen Visenya Targaryen traveled west on Vhagar at His High Holiness, the High Septon’s behest to Oldtown with her brother-son Prince Aegon Variys. Her son Dragon, Rhaenys’ older cousin Lord Allard Royce also joined them.
Princess Rhaena, Lady Melony, Aerea and Rhaella Targaryen had reached the west in search of sanctuary when they stumbled upon a Battle at Lannisport. Marq Farman, who had sworn his life to Prince Aegon's campaign was there. He pointed them towards Fair Isle as their most notable destination for refuge. Meanwhile, the fate of their fallen captive Aegon was growing more and more uncertain with each passing day. The girls set about getting to Fair Isle in haste but Stony Dread on Balerion’s back soon made short work of that journey. Though they could not help but watch with dread as they fled from what seemed like an unavoidable death or captivity of their own - all felt certain that second best would do just fine if it meant keeping the younger, smaller Targaryens safe within their own grasp.
Maegor I Targaryen and Aenys, sons of the great Conqueror Aegon I Targaryen, had summoned an army to the Iron Throne in a bid to peacefully reclaim their kingdom. But what they found at the Red Keep was a grim and cheerless aura that filled all who passed through its Gates. Lords from across the Seven Kingdoms flocked to join them in battle against those lords who had betrayed their family; Lady Melony Piper and three of her brothers as well as Lord Corbray and Allard Royce, who was Jeyne Westerling's cousin, amongst many more. The ensuing Conquest would be chronicled in tales for many generations until Aegon I's descendants returned home - returning Westeros back into balance.
The Targaryen loyalists had become hunted down and were soon slain, which led to King Maegor's beloved High Septon being put to death. In his stead, the Poor Fellows of the Seven Kingdoms raised up a new High Septon in Oldtown. To quell any opposition to the crown, Ser Joffrey Doggett and Red Dog of the Hills from House Tyrell had been sent out with a group of hedge knights, masterfully hunting down those believed to have spoken against King Maegor or his queens. Even Lord Peake's son was not spared and was cut down on his way to Honeyholt. The ancient enmity between Lannisters and Targaryens only seemed to be growing ever more fierce in these wild places.
Queen Visenya and Queen Alyssa, both Targaryens and siblings of King Jaehaerys and his beloved sister, Princess Alysanne had grown thin and haggard since being summoned to court. As Prince Viserys was kept well away from the throne as King Maegor was said to be deeply suspicious of even his own kin. Night's Watch brothers Ser Harys Horpe and Septon Pater were dispatched to Dragonstone with a contingent of loyal House Tyrell men-at-arms in order to bring back Lord Darklyn's aged father, Davos Baratheon, along with Rollingford, princely bastard born at Maidenpool. Ser Joffrey Doggett was sent out in the guise of hedge knight along with Red Dogge Of The Hills and other brave warriors in order to hunt down Targaryen loyalists who had spoken against the king or queens. They butchered anyone suspected on their way from Oldtown Seven Kingdoms to Honeyholt; an ancient enmity for those living in wild places of Westeros could be felt whirling through air making mark on fragile peace between them all.
Queen Alys had announced she was with child, and the whole court rejoiced. After weeks of confinement as desired by Her Grace, Grand Maester Desmond and the Septas took charge of her care to ensure that all would go well. With great diligence they tended to Queen Alys, with the Midwife Jeyne and Lady Hanna accompanying them in the royal chambers. This news caught the attention of King himself who remained on Dragonstone, having summoned his daughters Queen Visenya and Queen Alyssa there to keep him well away from any potential strife in King's Landing. As for Prince Viserys, he had grown thin and haggard in his beloved aunt's absence; a squire was made for him thusly, so as to provide companionship throughout this trying time.
Lady Alys and King Maegor had been overjoyed when she announced she was with child. Everyone in the court rejoiced, and the Septas took charge of her care. But when Lady Alys went into labour and birthed a stillborn baby, everyone's joy quickly turned to sorrow. As Lady Alys continued to bleed heavily from the twisted womb, King Maegor gallantly ordered that only sparingly intervention be taken -- though he himself was greatly distressed by this heavy blow of tragedy. Ever since then, House Targaryen had held dear the customs practiced by their Valyrian marriage predecessors; one that would grant them hope for their desired future.
The Iron Throne had been deceived into thinking that the royal court was peaceful, but this soon changed when King Maegor stood and threw his Hand of the King aside. Queen Tyanna and Queen Ceryse watched in fear as Maegor shouted orders to send men to find Lady Alys Harroway's Lord Father for her stillbirth. The Grand Maester comforted both queens as she turned and handed Lucas Harroway his newborn daughter, Tyanna. In a fit of rage fueled by grief, Lord Father ordered that no-one spare any mercy on House Harroway’s heavy crime--a twisted tale whose huge consequences would be felt across Seven Kingdoms.
Queen Alysanne had written to a select few among the secondary nobility asking for possible suitors for Tyanna and her daughter. With a wide net cast and given the context of what had been said before, many knights, squires, lords, servants and even gangs of smiths flocked in from far-off places to get their chance at glory. Old men as well as young men smiled upon upcoming opportunities to serve as husband or father-in-law to two royal ladies. Handsome men were sure of themselves but homely ones were not left out either bringing them all closer together at King's Hand hoping that luck would be on their side this day. Singers came along with tales of each suitor's renown which further heightened the atmosphere of excitement surrounding Queen Alys' quest.
Lord Harroway and the Kingsguard burst in on Queen Alys and her entourage in Maegor's Holdfast. Lord Harroway had paid no inkling as to their coming, so as they dragged the queen from her bed,  some of her protective sisters were killed. Then, Lord Harroway and his men flung Lord Father from its roof to smash upon the stones below. Afterwards, any who confessed were cast onto the spikes that lined the dry moat around Maegor’s Holdfast while those who had no inkling joined them nonetheless; simpleminded amongst them all alike lay dead upon the fortress walls.
The world felt heavy, only made worse by the pained cries of Queen Alys. Maegor had his revenge and she was dying - a never forgotten tragedy; but one that would soon be buried and forgotten. Despite her suffering, Tyanna remained calm, remaining by her sisters side until the end of her days; for in these seven words Tyanna knew what had to be done for peace to reign ever again. The worst of their stories were now over but al Ser's loyal conversation with Lord Harroway and House Tyrell had no inkling as to the darkness that bursted into Tower of the Hand merely moments later when he dragged from her bed Aenys Targaryen's daughter, for whom none could save- doomed to death amidst more torture before being thrown onto the spikes that lined the dry moat around Maegor’s Holdfast where so many others tragically joined them.
When Lady Tyanna arrived in King's Landing with Lord Lucas and her son, the late queen Queen Alys, Maegor was assembling a strong force of knights and men-at-arms and marched on Harrenhal to complete the destruction, where the entire garrison surrendered open without opposition. He did the same at Lord Harroway's Town and departed for Gods Eye with lighty held castles still left in his wake as he sailed away. The tales of what happened soon spread far beyond Westeros: from distant ports across Narrow Sea to Tyrosh or Vallasita, it seemed like everyone had heard something about Maegor I Targaryen's campaign of death.
Ser Walton Towers emerged from the violent tournament at Harrenhal victorious and coveted by many, eager to make entreaties for his service. Even King Maegor was determined to get Ser Walton to serve him - as both a celebrated knight of renown and an ambitious man-at-arms. Lord Alton Butterwell was first in line with offers of coin and landed titles, though Lord Darnold Darry eventually persuaded Ser Walton to join him in the melee's savage bloodletting against the people of Lord Harroway’s Town. After much debate, Maegor gracefully conceded victory and granted the two lords their requests. It seemed that while lightly held, Harrenhal had brought forth an unexpected victor this day: one whose fate would grant him far more than he ever imagined possible back when he departed from Rollingford some days ago.
King Maegor had finally returned to King's Landing to seat himself again upon the Iron Throne, greeted by a multitude of Westerosi lords and ladies. After the bloodletting that had occurred at Harrenhal, he made it clear that he would no longer grant any ambitious entreaties and his savage victory was already being coveted across the Realm. With Queen Vinsona and Queen Alyssa soon arriving to Dragonstone with Vermithor, Silverwing, and her other dragons after their escape from Dragonstone, Maegor proclaimed in the court that no event would follow her death with such majesty as when she herself entered King's Landing for the final time.
Prince Viserys had been sent a message by His Grace, Maegor regarding the interment of his mother's remains. Knowing that it would be hard to ignore such summon, Prince Viserys made the long journey back to King’s Landing with his entourage. The prince was greeted upon arrival by Lord Lucas Harroway and other important lords from House Tyrell, wishing him well and hoping for his safe return from Dragonstone. When he arrived at the castle, Lord Peake’s son loudly proclaimed the Prince’s return as the Conqueror entered through the gates of Dragonstone on Vermithor and Silverwing followed closely behind by Maegor and Queen Visenya in tow. However, there were rumors about Prince Viserys having planned to steal away with dragons after hearing about his mother's death but no matter what rumors may have said or not said, he returned back to seat himself again upon The Iron Throne. After few days an arrest warrant was signed under orders of Maegor Targaryen which commanded all men of Kingsguard to seize Prince Viserys and chain him up in black irons while secretly questioning him regarding Mother Conquerer's burial arrangements whilst making sure none could go against King Maegor's commands on this matter any more.
Ser Owen Bush, of Maegor’s Kingsguard, had been with the king when he burned and was interred. He was sent to seize and chain those who questioned His Grace’s mother’s place in the Conqueror’s line and his claimed authority over Westeros. Knowing Ser Owen would turn up dead, the king could only accept it and take solace in House Tyrell of Rollingford who were faithfully supporting him as well as Septon Pater who had first brought news that his aunt Deria Martell feared for her brother's wrath. Despite this, Prince Viserys's power seemed to grow larger than ever before, leaving a hazy uncertainty clouding what may happen next to The Seven Kingdoms if something didn't change soon.
Prince Viserys plied Tyanna of Pentos with her dark arts and questioning, but his efforts yielded no results. In a fit of anger, he left the woman out in the ward of the Red Keep for a fortnight without food or water, until Queen Alyssa consigned her to fire. With much loved Ser Owen Bush valiantly defending Maegor's Kingsguard, knowing full well that many had already died defending their king in the past, it was clear that none present could turn up to oppose him this time.
King Maegor celebrated the completion of the Red Keep by hosting a grand feast in the court to honor all of its builders and workers. Drowned God prayers were sung and plied with sweetmeats and strongwine for three days as revels lasted throughout the city. After feasting, Maegor had those who built his great castle interred in it's very walls, but even then the celebration upset some pious lords who protested that the King had not paid or thanked those he much loved builders properly. Later they found their protests falling on deaf ears when Kingsguard knights moved into the Red Keep and put all remaining workmen to sword.
Queen Ceryse, wife of King Maegor, was a shrewish and largely unpopular woman across the realm. When an illness suddenly overcame Queen Ceryge and she struggled to pass it on, hopes were high that she would soon be removed. Unfortunately all prayers went unanswered as the Queen slipped away quietly in her castle bedroom, where Lord Tyanna had been keeping her company. It was widely believed that Maegor had blackened his queen's heart even further with strange Valyrian marriage customs but also that he found solace in sweetmeats and strongwine when sorrow threatened to overwhelm him at her passing.
Maegor, the new King of Westeros, made a point to prove his Targaryen strength by forcing off any and all who resisted him. He began with the building of Dragonpit atop Rhaenys’s Hill near the Red Keep; it was a small token compared to the large-scale construction stretching from Myr to Volantis. Maegor's motivation seemed clear: he wanted to create a seat of power that would last for centuries beyond his own rule. This plan proved successful, and in time, the Dragonpit stood tall and proud as one of the most recognizable symbols of Targaryen supremacy in all of Westeros. Despite some resistance from those who viewed it as a corrupted lordly indulgence, Maegor's grand ambition soon set an example that even far away cities like Tyrosh could not ignore.
King Maegor and Queen Tyanna took the field against the outlawed remnants of the Faith Militant, hunting down scores of their followers, sending many to the Wall and hanging those who refused to take the black. Lord Edwell Celtigar provided an invaluable service by helping to elude Poxy Jeyne Poore, last leader against them. Despite all their efforts, Poxy did not prove defeated until late in year 45 AC when she was betrayed by three of her own followers with whom she fled into a great wood south of King's Landing. They received pardons and knighthoods as their reward for aiding to run off Poxy Jeyne.
His Grace King Maegor had declared a war against the outlawed remnants of the Faith Militant and had taken the field himself alongside his vanguard to hunt down scores of rebels, sending many to the Wall or hanging those who refused to take the black. After months on campaign, Poxy Jeyne was surprisingly able to elude him until at last she was betrayed by three of her own followers, who received pardons and knighthoods as their reward. Late in year 45 AC, news came that she was held prisoner in Wendwater, near The Great Fork. King Maegor ordered her execution then and there and a rescue attempt commenced with clubs & axes by brave Poor Fellows againstSer Horys Hill's men supported by cavalry hearding them from all sides. The anticipated slaughter soon burst out and many died before daybreak yet despite being surrounded from all directions Poxy Jeyne managed to stay alive until the very last moments when Lord Edwell Celtigar arrived with an entourage of Lords Tyrell followed close behind as they sang praise for he triumphant return back home after extinguishing another rebellion against His Grace's reign.
King Maegor had ordered his loyal subjects, Ser Joffrey Doggett and Dennis the Lame to roam throughout the realm, preaching of his grandeur and severity. They vanished into Oldtown, Golden Tooth and Casterly Rock where many citizens of the Realm began to turn away from the King and despise him. Septon Moon, High Lickspittle and Ragged Silas then rose up to lead protests against the King in these places. As they continued to rally more smallfolk against him — their success only heightened by news of execution, rescue attempts gone awry at Wendwater, slaughters at Great Fork — it was anticipated that he would soon be surrounded by enemies should something not be done soon. Sure enough, when His Grace made another visit with an entourage of famous knights like Knight Warrior's Sons' Ser Harys Hill for protection - all hell broke loose as those opposing him raised arms against them. When those Poor Fellows were slaughtered or died trying; Queen Visenya Targaryen's son Prince Maegor managed to make off with a few alive in his wake but it was too little too late for many as Lord Tully of Riverrun declared this last stand a loss before voicing what everyone had been dreading: "It is over".
King Maegor returned from his campaigning with a convoy of families in tow - simple grisly trophies dumped at his feet as offering wherever he passed. To the poor smallfolk, Maegor was a warrior’s son who held those much less fortunate than him raised up by their own guilt and revenged labors. He took the Iron Throne and ruled in all but name from the Red Keep when everyone else had turned away or despised what he had done. Now, many feared what would come of all these people he gathered together for after all, who can predict the whims of such a powerful man?
As the coming of the new year was upon them, King Maegor and his wife Tyanna were certain they had found what they sought - a way to be legitimized in not just the eyes of their Westerosi counterparts at court but also by The Faith on lands beyond. Yet as soon as King Maegor returned from his campaigning in Foreigner's Land to hear rumors that Village West of Gods Eye bore witness to an old Valyrian marriage custom which Lord Aryon Tyrell and Princess Deria of Rollingford had adopted: “A joined fate for nobleline and gods,” he knew that any chance he'd wanted for something new from this desired union would come true no longer.
As the new year began, tensions ran high throughout the Seven Kingdoms. Lord Velaryon of Driftmark and Lord Celtigar had agreed to Maegor's suggestion of taking a new wife, and urged him to send for the proud and lovely Woman of Starfall, Clarisse Dayne. The two parted ways as Grand Maester Benifer offered his opinion about Rhaena Targaryen having been legitimized so that she might join Queen Alyssa in Dorne if desired. As it turned out, Clarisse Dayne was indeed a stout woman with seven children - two young maiden daughters included - but after hearing her description on fertility, many lords could not help but have their doubts about the match. Little did they know however that fate had already begun writing events set to unfold with this union; unknown forces perhaps? Whatever lay ahead was yet unseen yet eagerly sought by all involved.  Meanwhile far away in Starfall, Larissa Velaryon contemplated her next move at Andalos where King Harren's famous knights awaited their challengers seeking honor - or themselves a way out of Westeros.
King Maegor scorned the advice offered by his lords, taking root in his choice to have Queen Alyssa take a new wife from across the narrow sea, to Tyrosh or perhaps Volantis. The reaction from Butterwell and Lord Celtigar was one of surprise, but Lord Velaryon remained silent. His suggestion had been made with every good intention but ultimately fell upon deaf ears; whether it was some dark shadow that led him not to speak is up for debate. It came as no surprise then when he remained in hiding shortly after, leaving Westeros with Princess Rhaena and Aegon the Uncrowned before fleeing to Dragonstone where they would remain. His actions were seen as a representation of how ruling decisions could weaken the Targeryen power if left unchecked; clearly Maegor had taken more than just a fat and homely queen during his reign.
Rhaena Targaryen had to act quickly after the death of her husband - King Maegor. Together with her son, Prince Aegon and daughter Aerea, she fled across the narrow sea to Fair Isle, where trumpet vines grew in abundance and the people dyed their hair changed to conceal their true identities. She entrustingly sent away Aerea to be fostered by Lord Edwell Celtigar of Claw Isle in the far west of Westeros while Rhaella remained in hiding at Fair Isle as scorned rumors that they were kin to Queen Alyssa's deposed Four False Kings took root. Queen Alysanne's entourage had been weakened when those lords who represented House Targaryen fled or remained in hiding. Rhaena fought hard to ensure good a worthy future for her children so they could take their rightful place without fear like Princess Deria of House Tyrell at Rollingford who was fated only for faith amoung pious lords and Septas throughout The Realm.
Rhaena Targaryen had to act quickly, and with the help of a trumpet sound from Prince Aegon, Aerea and Rhaella arranged for her escape. She had dyed her dark hair blonde and changed into garb designed for disguising herself -- slender built with pale blue silvery threads draping down -- so no one would recognize her on their flight to Fair Isle. By entrusting House Tyrell in Rollingford she fostered good relations between them, knowing that they were worthy allies.
Rhaena Targaryen had escaped to Fair Isle, carefully disguising her slim and pale-blue form with new garb before boarding a ship bound for the small island. After arriving in Faircastle, she knew that she was hidden from sight and took a deep breath of relief as she stopped moving for the first time in days. As she rested in thesafety of Faircastle, Rhaena began reading prayers while wondering how easily Maegor could reach her on Farman’s tall white castle set high above the sea. Marq Farman had granted her safe passage to this place, but now Rhaena doubted if it would be so easy for such protections to remain.
Rhaena had been summoned to the Red Keep by King Maegor, giving her defiance on how to marry Lord Farman, and Androw soon followed. Mounted upon Balerion, they flew across Fair Isle that Marq Farman had granted them and through to the castle. Rhaena learned of a triple wedding when she arrived - it was feared that if she did not comply sooner there would be consequences for her kindess. As an old man of the Faith whispered prayers in the corner and lords reading ancient texts, Rhaena rested restlessly in Faircastle, wondering what downfalls awaited her should she stand up against such forces as Lords Tyrell and Rollingford; even Aegon I themselves had been easily bent from his original tall and white dreams high above Westeros.
Lady Jeyne of House Westerling had been courted by the young prince, Aegon, since arriving to the Red Keep with her family. She knew his affections were genuine and so when he asked for her hand in marriage, she couldn't refuse. However, Lord Farman warned of a threat from Maegor Targaryen that could undermine their dreams, who was planning an attack on Casterly Rock in what would soon become known as the Battle Beneath the Gods Eye. The lovebirds persevered through despite all odds and decided to wed sooner than expected before Maegor could ruin their chance of salvation. Lord Farman shared a few heartfelt words of defiance acknowledging the courage it must have taken for them to defy such an intimidating foe, mounting Balerion and flying away to Fair Isle which left King Androw fearing for their safety - but also proud at their newfound kindness.
Lady Elinor Costayne had been arrested for the murder of King Maegor Targaryen and charged with high treason, but many protested her innocence. Her house's allies from House Westerling and other places across The Realm came to show their support for Lady Elinor, mourning her fall from grace as she was summoned before Queen Alyssa's court in Oldtown. Though young men like Ser Theo Bolling, who had courted Lady Jeyne Tarbeck posthumously, were troubled by this most troubling of events that had landed them in court.
A terrible air of discontent filled the city; it seemed that every day there were news of King Maegor's actions causing outrage and unrest. On this fateful spring day, Septon Moon travelled to Stoney Sept with a large entourage of pious lords, Kingsguard and people of King's Landing. He denounced King Maegor's wedding plans and his decision to take three wives in an effort to uphold the Valyrian marriage customs - a move which was cheered wildly by the masses who had already raised their voices against him in protest. Meanwhile, Queen Alyssa and Queen Elinor had been summoned by High Septon from Oldtown, where they would travel across the narrow sea to Tyrosh in order for him to perform the marriage rites. Clearly worried about what fate might befall them as a result of all this, both Queens trembled as they sailed away from Westeros on that warm Spring day.
On the warm spring day of Lady Jeyne and Lady Elinor's wedding, rumors ran wild. The crowd cheered along with the Queens as Septon Moon performed the marriage rites for Princess Rhaena and Queen Tyanna, doing their best to quell any foolish dissenters who spoke against it. As Lord Lucas Harroway looked down from his view atop Maegor's Holdfast, he could see members of House Tyrell and Rollingford ensuring a smooth ceremony as an attempt to ease any tensions felt by the people of King's Landing about such a grandiose event that was sure far exceed expectations.
A grand wedding celebration was in order - King Jaehaerys had arranged three intentional unions between four of his daughters, Lady Jeyne Westerling, Lady Elinor Costayne, Princess Rhaena Targaryen and Queen Tyanna to ensure the prosperity and safety of their shared kingdom. As the three new Black Brides rode away with His Grace on separate litters after their wedding festivities concluded, it was whispered among the crowds that all three unions had been consummated each night when they reluctantly shared a single bed as per Valyrian marriage customs. Some even dared claim that one night Princess Rhaena had attempted to kill the king by scratching his back to bloody ribbons. In sinister tales told by fevered minds, these events were mixed and moulded together with tales of a fertility potion offered to each couple which throw strange and queer contradictions in telling a story consistent enough for truths be separated from legends.
Maegor Targaryen watched on in disbelief as the wedding ceremony took place at Highgarden. He had been declared disinherited and his royal authority was now confirmed by the Lord Father of House Tyrell, forcing him to turn over his siblings Rhaena, Aerea, and Rhaella to separate unions that would bind all three houses together. Even King Jaehaerys stood among them, powerless before Lord Mace's forces. The act contradicted all Valyrian marriage customs; it had become queer for such a thing to happen without Maegor's knowledge or consent. But, since the Seven Kingdoms were turned against them, none of them could do anything except accept what was sent down from the Mountains of Dorne to Oldtown and many other places across Westeros. As he saw Ser Harys confirm Lord Tyrell's orders with a nod of affirmation from Princess Deria, Maegor just knew deep inside that this would not be the last time they will have to suffer through strange and conflicting events which appeared too hard to try make sense out.
Queen Jeyne had hardly been brought to bed with her stillborn child when Lord Edwell Celtigar announced the shocking news: Queen Elinor, Maegor's queen, was with child. The announcement caused an uproar throughout the kingdom, from Oldtown to Highgarden and all places in between - including Tarbeck Hall. People flocked to Casterly Rock to shower the young queen with gifts and honors. Soon Alys Harroway arrived at court as well; she had been sent by King Jaehaerys and confirmed Maegor's disinheritance of Rhaena, Rhaella and their children after he declared them bastards before the crowds of Seven Kingdoms. Despite the sudden monstrous news, Queen Jeyne was showered extravagantly while they waited for Elinor's reveal of pregnancy towards summer end.
Maegor's descent into madness led to multiple victims. He slayed his own nephew, the High Septon, Ser Owen Bush and Ser Maladon Moore for conspiring against him. He even poisoned Jeyne Westerling's child in her womb and Alys Harroway's whelp in her womb. Maegor defied the gods, made war against The Faith and the High Septon and declared any actions of his a capital crime - something unimaginable for a Targaryen king reigning from the Red Keep's Traitor's Table. Queens Tyanna Delivered and Jeyne Westerling were seized by Maegor forces and brought down to their fate of dungeons while Lord Edwell Celtigar courageously tried appealing to the King with Queen Elinor Costayne at his side. No mercy was shown as Maegor enforced power upon all of Oldtown despite it being a City Of The Most Devout - surely an abomination now after being polluted by such gruesome acts committed under command of Mad Maegor.
King Maegor had been dealt a cruel hand: he was said to have slayed his own brother and fed his heart to his dogs. His beloved niece Tyanna of the Tower also met an unfortunate end; she was arrested, charged with treason and cutting out the tongues of Westerosi lords. Having had her revenge against those who wronged her uncle, Tyanna promised that Maegor would turn again against those who accused him, but fate turned its back on them both when Tyanna was delivered of a malformed and stillborn child, an eyeless boy born with rudimentary wings – a portent of Blackfyre, predicted by Lord Bar Emmon and feared by even High Septon themselves. As though ordered by divine intervention, Queen Elinor soon arrived at the Red Keep's Traitor's Tower to make good on her promise made to Maegor earlier - it was time for justice.
The leaders of the realm assembled in Riverrun, while King Harren asked Lord Oakheart of Oldtown and Lord Rowan of the Reach to join him in his march across The Reach to Oldtown. Falling in line behind them was Maegor, Septon Moon, Ser Joffrey Doggett and Lord Edwell Celtigar from Dornish Marches. As they reached Starry Sept, their forces seemed to evaporate around them like a melting snow falling away - leaving only King Harren and a couple hundred brave loyalists as far as the eye could see. Suddenly, Lord Lickspittle appeared with his entourage from House Tyrell and Sextons from Rollingford by his side. Headed toward the coffin-shaped sept overlooking the city, Lickspittle resigned himself to bearding King Harren in an effort to replace Tyanna of Tower whom he had once promised would find justice at last against Queen Elinor who had long fed her heart to her dogs after having it cut out by Maegor's menacing Blackfyre sword.
As Lord Rogar Baratheon proclaimed his declaration in Shipbreaker Bay, his words flew all across Westeros. By the commandment of His Grace Jaehaerys Targaryen and Queen Alyssa, Rogar named Prince Jaehaerys as the rightful heir to the throne and vowed that all lawful men of Westeros swear fealty to these true kings gifted by Vermithor. The lands spoke of how handsome and gracious the young prince was and they told their children tales of this proclamation that had brought so many lords from near and far - some even turning up from Andalos or Valyria - to gather at Oldtown for this historic event; a glittering gathering that replaced any previous unrest with loyalty to what was now seen as true justice.
Jaehaerys, Rhaena Targaryen, and Aerea Blackfyre mounted their dragons and flew over Shipbreaker Bay back to the Red Keep. Jaehaerys had gathering forces in both Storm's End and The Eyrie in order to protect the Seven Kingdoms after abandoning Westeros when his proclamation was proclaimed at last. Jeyne Westerling, cousin of Queen Tyanna who had been so handsomely gifted by Lord Lucas Harroway, along with her entourage had also travelled with Jaehaerys as they flew away from Ser Harys Hill's abandoned cradle of House Tyrell, Rollingford. Allard Royce had stolen one close friend from them; Poxy Jeyne Poore, who was accompanied by a couple of young men that he'd found in Stoney Sept. As they soared across valleys below them on their way home, all swore vowing that this time House Targaryen would follow the lawful commands befitting a true ruler of the kingdom and commanded justice for all lords of Westeros.
King Maegor and his entourage went to King's Landing where the Grand Maester Benifer was summoned by the king himself. However, it seemed like Princess Aerea had vanished with some of her loyal subjects after they had taken a ship for Pentos. Lord Hightower, Jaehaerys, and Ser Owen Bush offered their services to the king upon hearing this news; though confused why such an act would take place, neither party thought twice about taking action. Mounted on horses, they flew across the realm in pursuit—abandoning Red Keep and Storm's End in search of stolen property.
The news came that Lord Velaryon had left Driftmark and was to be followed by Jaehaerys, prompting King Maegor to declare war on Lord Velaryon's allies in the Reach. Upon receiving this urgent news, Maegor sailed for Highgarden with a mighty fleet of dragonships, determined to see his orders enacted before departing from Oldtown towards the Arbor and Casterly Rock, finally arriving at Runestone where he was met with stiff resistance. Meanwhile, Princess Deria Tyrell called upon House Rollingford for aid, fleeing the turmoil in Highgarden only to eventually vanish along with her leal men. Everyone else became sluggish and confused; rumors circulated around Westeros about mysterious figures that had been seen stuffing coins into sacks while they summoned ships destined were taken far beyond Aenys’ sight of the Seven Kingdoms.
The lesser lords in King's Landing had gathered at Maegor's command, only to be shocked when the Prince asked for volunteers to journey with him to Duskendale, Stonedance, Harrenhal, Rook’s Rest and Sharp Point. Lord Darklyn was one of the first to rise from his seat with many of the other reactions ranging from admiration to disbelief. Although Maegor could have called upon his Kingsguard or the mighty lords of House Tyrell and Lannister he wanted men he knew would never waver in their loyalty; Lord Massey, Lord Towers, Lord Staunton , Lord Bar Emmon  and even a reluctant Lord Buckwell stepped forth as well as Lords Rosby, Stokeworth, Hayford, Harte, Byrch Rollingford and Bywater. With Mallery not leaving his side all were looking further into this latest venture by Prince Maegor Targaryen but all they could do now was follow the orders given.
Maegor, His Grace and the gathered lesser Lords of the Iron Throne were brought together in the Red Keep to discuss plans for battle. Lord Hayford, Lord Rosby and Lord Towers contemplated Maegor's urge to abdicate as sorrowfully as did their own lost hearts. When it was learned that Lord Buckwell had spoken against his plans, Maegor ordered him to beheaded - a decision which left some of those present appalled. While few made plans of action, Maegor brooded on the Iron Throne, waiting until some kind of solution could be found.
Maegor had come seeking Queen Elinor at the Iron Throne. He had been there often in recent days, brooding on its jagged edges. Tears soaked his pale face as he uttered a faint plea for her - it was their last chance for redemption. But when Maegor came to the hall, it was soaked in blood from his latest wrathful order: Lord Hayford and his kin beheaded immediately upon leaving Red Keep's walls. His urge for justice had broken him and even with Lords Tower and Rosby brought together, he had lost heart and made plans to abdicate and take the black. With these few words, gone were Maegor's shivers of hope as he watched Elinor approach the throne room; dreading what would happen next..
Queen Elinor had come seeking justice for the murder of her first husband, but was met instead with a solemn silence in the throne room of the Iron Throne. The Kingsguard who were there presided over by Maegor paid no heed to her cries. In their eyes, her claim seemed impossible to believe that one so close to them had done such an act. The Queen swore on her life that it was true and Maegor forced his will upon them, acting as if he already knew it was true from the start. As Elinor stormed out of the Red Keep, she quickly vanished into unknown territory leaving only whispers of her story behind like a bloodied trail marking those left alive and those long gone; pale reminders of what had occured amongst jagged rocks stained red with blood.
King Maegor I Targaryen, also known as Maegor the Cruel, had just died in the Red Keep after a long and tumultuous reign of terror. Rumors began to spread like wildfire throughout the Seven Kingdoms- his body was burned beyond recognition and then secretly interred at Dragonstone. By dawn's light most believed something sinister had taken place but no one knew what strange practices were undertaken that fateful night or why King Maegor's remains had left Westeros unannounced for an unknown location leaving many questions about his death alive and hidden forever.
