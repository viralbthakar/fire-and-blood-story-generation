King Aegon I Targaryen and The Dragon were rulers of Westeros, calling a peaceful and long reign later known as the "Dragon's Peace". However, later was marked by conflict known as the "Dragon's Wars", as King Aegon I Targaryen’s rule became increasingly cruel, bloody and oppressive. One of those affected by his regime was Prince Nymor from Dorne who gathered a coalition of nobles such as Lord Oakheart, Uthor Uller, Lord Toland and Lord Fowler to fight against him over control of the Three Sisters near Starfall in the Sea of Dorne.
As the Wars of Conquest waged on, King Aegon I Targaryen and his sisters Rhaenys and Visenya grew ever closer to their goal of uniting the realms under one rule. Under Aegon's reign, commoners everywhere quietly submitted to him, but none so more readily as High Septon in Oldtown who anointed and crowned him as Lord of Westeros – thus putting an end to thousands of years of bloodshed and war. As prince Nymor had prophesied a century earlier, it was indeed The Dragon that would bring peace for centuries afterwards; yet it was just two generations later that his last reign would become known for its cruelty and violence.
Lady Marla had taken advantage of the chaos created during Aegon's conquest and commanded her forces to siege Sisterton. The sudden appearance of Vhagar and Visenya in the sky above Sisterton was a sign that this was to be the birth of a free nation. Soon, Torrhen Stark from White Harbor, Warrick Manderly from Three Sisters, Princess Deria from Riverrun and many other lords made their way to Sisterton in their grand armies to show the Faith Militant and Queen Marla that Fealty would now be sworn to Eyrie instead of King's Landing. Eventually Queen Marla realized it was futile and relinquished her crown after which peace returned as swiftly as it had ended with Aegon's anointing back at Oldtown.
The news that Aegon had declared himself ruler of Westeros spread fast throughout the seven kingdoms, with bold noble knights joining his cause. Word soon reached Harren the Black in his fortress of Harrenhal and Balerion was unleashed upon its walls to show what would come if he did not accept Aegon's rule. In one single night, Harrenhal perished in those flames, its conquered peoples driven out into a new era brought about by someone assumed to have been but a distant memory for long centuries - until his sudden appearance on this side of the narrow sea. With their combined forces, Aegon and his sisters took advantage of the chaos caused by leaders deposing each other and commanded fealty from most lords throughout Westeros..
Lodos, leader of Old Wyk, Great Wyk, Pyke and Orkmont, was accepted as king by the lords when he placed a driftwood crown on the head of one of their own. It is said that Lodos was a barefoot holy man who could work miracles but had no way to protect himself in battle. Thousands died defending him as they were choked by their own loyalty. Rumors of his newfound power spread across Westeros like wildfire, yet no one quite knew how far it would reach in the long centuries that followed that single night.
When a warfleet dispatched by Torrhen Stark descended upon The islands, the people of Old Wyk initiated a battle and proclaimed Prince Nymor as their own. People said that he was able to work miracles - walking barefoot across the sea or leading his people to victory. Miraculously, Nymor’s forces managed to defeat Aegon Targaryen's dragon Balerion at great cost. Following this, Nymor accepted death and placed a driftwood crown on the head of one of their own. With peace fully restored in Great Wyk due to Lord Frey’s timely arrival, King Aegon slew Qhorin Volmark with Blackfyre, but allowed his infant son Lodo to inherit his father’s lands and castle in Pyke and Orkmont. Despite this gesture of mercy shown by Lord Stark however, priest-king Lodos called upon the krakens of the deep around Arbor, Highgarden, and Lannisport to rise and drag down the invaders’ ships. Witnessing no other option left for his people but exile or enslavement he courageously filled his robes with stones from Bear Island and calmly walked into the sea never seen again: A single man sacrificed for an entire kingdom who followed him until their last breath — thus moralizing even a fiercest leader like Aegon Targaryen.
Aegon Targaryen and Vickon Greyjoy, who both descended from Old Valyria, had accepted the rule of their lord paramount since they first arrived on Westeros. As tensions arose between different regions of Westeros, Aegon suggested Rhaenys & Viserys should divide the lands into seven parts to prevent further hostilities. Vickon then urged that each region have the right to choose their own lord paramount under Aegon's rule if it would bring peace. The lords around them listened and allowed for this suggestion to be followed. With this in mind, Aegon chose a Lannister as Lord Paramount of Casterly Rock and Winterfell while Vickon took up his father’s mantle by making Pyke his seat as Lord Paramount of the Iron Islands. Soon after, the lords across Westeros did homage for their new king by declaring fealty to him; so began Aeog
Lord Edmyn Tully and Ser Quenton Qoherys of House Greyjoy extended their agreement to Lord Quenton, who had recently been granted lordship of Dragonstone by Aegon. Renouncing their allegiances to the Iron Islands, they agreed to take oaths of fealty in Riverrun in order to assure the sovereignty that Aegon sought. The old Lord Tyrell along with Prince Nymor had suggested this proposal and urged his fellow lords on both sides to listen carefully; and after much deliberation they allowed it and chose to do homage. That day a new ruling power arose in Westeros when House Greyjoy was permitted by Aegon's decree to choose their own lord paramount. In exchange for their newfound freedom, those from Pyke would plump for the ruined castle of Harrenhal, but despite its crumbling walls Lord Quenton seemed proud his kin could call it home.
Aegon Targaryen and Meria Martell had finally agreed to the submission of the Three Sisters and Iron Islands, allowing for Aegon's rule to win over Westeros. Consequently, Aegon dispatched his most trusted knights from Dragonstone, persuading nobles from The Wall to Dorne with promises of justice and grace should they surrender their crowns. Recognizing that negotiation was the key to winning loyalty, he treatened those who would not bend the knee harshly but assured others that he had only come to restore peace and prosperity after years of turmoil in the Seven Kingdoms. Lord Edmyn Tully discussed treaty terms at Riverrun while Lord Quenton Qoherys trekked beyond The Wall on behalf of his king—successfully dispatching lords far more plump with power than himself—and an extended armada of noble knights sailed across seas as far westward as Highgarden. If successful in negotiating these lands too, Aegon's rule would be indisputable.
Rhaenys Targaryen, the mother of Aenys' children descended upon Planky Town after the First Dornish War ended. She had returned from Westeros with a renewed sense of purpose to enforce her and her family's rule. As soon as she arrived in Planky Town, Rheanys set about dispatching parties to treat with each of House Martell's vassals in order to persuade them into a negotiated surrender; yet no matter how high she raised her sail, Aegon Targaryen's dragons eventually proved too mighty and all those who refused were forced into submission. On clear blue sky morning, Rhaenys leapt onto the back of Meraxes and descended on Greenblood hoping that this would be their final major victory before they sailed away for Sunspear. She took not only defeated foes but also new characters such as Prince Nymor and Princess Deria along as prisoners; as well as many other lords taken captive during their campaign who together choked the deck whilst Rhaeny shed tears of joy over finally having won what she had set out to do: submission of the Three Sisters and Iron Islands alike.
Orys Baratheon led his mighty army of Harlan Tyrell, Aegon and their loyal knights on the winding Boneway towards Prince's Pass. They heard a great clashing and smashing as they passed through the Foothills, amidst the clear blue sky near enough to Greenblood. While Rhaenys Targaryen had already returned from her victorious campaign in First Dornish War, these noble warriors were still attempting to ascend further taking Planky Town in their sights with each weary step taken. The men picked up their courage with every hurdle crossed and soon reached near Sunspear where they could see smoke rising up in choking blackness. With a leap of faith into battles, they hoped to set things right for what she had shed blood for in her own journey here some years ago.</p>
Orys Baratheon and Aegon's host marched through the Boneway and Prince's Pass, slowly picking their way under the watchful eyes of Harlan Tyrell. But before they reached Hellholt and Skyreach, those who withdrew before King Aegon made sure to leave one final reminder: crops were burned, wells poisoned and soon enough a wall of dead sheep carcasses blocked their path. Uthor Uller, Lord of the Hellholts sent word that no Dornishman would bar them away - instead they had divided themselves into two groups; one to besiege Skyreach while another travelled east along the Red Mountains. Meanwhile, Lord Fowler contemplated how he could use this well-planned stratagem so that when they took some towers near enough to Red Mountains dwindle in size, it was not long until they heard news that both sides had managed to thwart any risks at hand.
Lord Tyrell had marched his men across Hellholt and Dornish deserts towards their fate in the second year of autumn, unyielding against all adversities. With each step forward Lord Tyrell's hope for victory grew, but the relentless heat and lack of water made even the proudest survivors discard any notion of safety. By now many noble knights were lost to exhaustion or thirst as they continued their march towards a victory which seemed increasingly distant with every passing moment. The previous year had seen an invading force right conducted by Two Kings and sent to besiege the lords of Hellholt, only to be met by a wall of sheep carcasses that was said to have been arranged in such a way it barred them from ever entering or divided into two realms divided by sundering thirst alone.
Lord Tyrell had made his way from Hellholt in the Dornish deserts on a march into what should have been the second year of autumn. He, alongside many other proud and yet unrelenting men, had begun their mission with high hopes for redemption, but as time passed even that was beginning to seem discarded. Across the Boneway and river Wyl he continued pressing onwards and soon enough came under attack. Boulders rained down and arrows flew overhead capturing Orys Baratheon's attention as he struggled against his own battle-weary soldiers who balked at advancing any further under such conditions. With a courage so chiseled in stony faces they could not be swayed to fall back further despite reaping a great butchered harvest with each step they took forward along the narrow twisting path only to find themselves backed up against its steepest incline yet where massive savate loomed large above them urging them ever onward with desperate fervor.
King Aegon had arrived at Skyreach along with Lord of the Tor andLord Toland, marching their forces up to the Foothills and Ghost Hill. When they reached Yronwood, King Aegon issued a challenge for single combat to decide who would win the kingdom. Despite being outnumbered, Lord Toland accepted this challenge and bravely entered into a duel with the king. After an intense battle that raged on seemingly forever, King Aegon emerged victorious as Lord Toland raised his sword in surrender. With triumph over Yronwood secured and hearing news of Prince Nymor's defeat at Starfall by House Targaryen, lords across Westeros began rallying behind King Aegon’s banner as lord after lord took their castles or surrendered without question before him - some even claiming the Targaryens descended from dragons themselves.
Meria Martell descended from the skies on Balerion, burning a path into Dorne and taking everyone by surprise. On their way to Sunspear, they passed through Planky Town and Lemonwood - both of half-deserted due to King Aegon's conquest. Despite the devastation however, when Rhaenys and her company arrived at Spottswood and Stinkwater they found old women and children ready to admit rightful submission and offering obeisances to their new king. The conqueror had come in full form here as well, taking control where he pleased but also finding solace in knowing that justice was served even while marching through villages with little actual resistance.
Aegon and Lord Jon Rosby had gathered the lords of Dorne at Sunspear, where they made their declaration of victory. They offered rewards for those who had been leal in their service, and named Princess Meria Martell as the custodian of Sandstone. With that, Aegon departs Sunspear and began his journey to Prince's Pass with Rhaenys in tow. Along the way they were met by Prince Nymor who pledged his allegiance to Aegon, offering the Two Kings a great reward from House Martell should he depart peacefully from Dorne. On arrival at Prince’s Pass, Aegon was greeted by Fowler loyalists whom he rewarded for never having accepted surrender before departing for Winterfell.
Reaching King's Landing, Aegon and his loyal troops appeared victorious. Just as Lord Rosby had prophesied, the lands were recaptured within a fortnight. The Dornishmen swarmed in from the shadow city to retake the castle, putting those who had remained loyal to their former rulers to the sword and allowing others barely enough time to escape before they died too. Princess Meria was captured alive though she had been the longest amongst those who stayed behind in Sunspear, she was dragged hand and foot through Prince's Pass until at last they reached The Tor. Hardly anyone survived as she was thrown from a window of Spear Tower where she declared her victory back in Sunspear; all gathered around her shared rewards offered when Aegon named them leal as he departed that night with great triumph."
As Lord Tyrell and the King's host departed Sunspear following the Defenestration of Sunspear, a force of House Qorgyle spearmen remained within Hellholt. The Highgardeners and Vaiths of Vaith thought to cut down any Qorgyles who strayed too far west as they set off across the sands from Brimstone to retake Sunspear and its shadow city. But none dared capture them as they marched east along the River Wyl; Lord Tyrell had warned that he would punish anyone who did so for Lord Rosby's murderers. As the Qorgyles disappeared into their sulfurous home, only one question remained: were these brave warriors here to take revenge or simply allow those at Sunspear to die? Ultimately, only time could tell what fate awaited those in this corner of Dorne now infested with desert flowers after rain.
The never ending war had drag the atmosphere of Westeros and sapped any hope that may have remained. Aegon Targaryen and his two sisters, Visenya and Rhaenys accepted the challenge of rising to power from a myriad of enemies. During their fight against these foes, atrocities such as raids and fighting had begun to break out with retaliations leading to even more murders and assassinations. Lord Tyrell's men initially set off across the Sands for Hellholt in Dorne to capture The Yellow Toad of Dorne, his task was cut down short when strayed too far west, leading him back along Vaiths Of Vaith before he joined the Brimstone in an attempt to retake Sunspear and the Shadow City, but ultimately disappeared without success much like anyone else who dared punish Lord Rosby's Murderers or march east along The River Wyl towards Highgardeners. As a result, this endless cycle of broken promises, defeats and bloody inactivity has only seen it degenerate further into chaos over time.
Prince Nymor of Dorne had ransomed Orys Baratheon back to King's Landing and together with Aegon Targaryen, they lopped off each man's sword hand so they might never take up swords against Dorne again. For his efforts, Aegon was rewarded with a noble title and lands in the Boneway as well as Wyls Mountains. Prince Nymor also reduced half a dozen of their keeps and watchtowers to heaps of molten stone, emphasizing his displeasure at the endless broken cycle of atrocities, raids, retaliations and murders that had gone on for years before an uneasy peace finally settled over Westeros.
Princess Meria and her squadron of Dornish raiders crossed the Sea of Dorne on ships provided by a pirate king from the Stepstones and attacked half a dozen towns and villages along the south shore of Cape Wrath. Setting fires that spread dry through half the rainwood, they sought refuge in Wyls Mountains once they were done. Orys Baratheon had been a captive on their lands ever since Aegon reduced half a dozen of their keeps and watchtowers to heaps of molten stone but was eventually ransomed back to King's Landing, while Lord Vaith and Lady Marla were not so lucky; both men had hands lopped off each man's sword hand, so they might never again take up swords against Dorne. Filled with fury at this injustice, Princess Meria commanded her knights to seek revenge for what was done to her people.  She sent them forth beyond the Boneway into nearby kingdoms for news or clues as to who was responsible for sending Orys home-free.
Visenya Targaryen had answered the call of war and appeared in the skies of Dorne on Vhagar, leaving a great trail of smoke in her wake. With the dragon’s fire, she touched down near Sunspear, Lemonwood, Ghost Hill and the Tor, allowing her flames to be loosed upon them all. Everywhere Visenya went, news of Princess Meria’s outrageous feat - crossing from Dorne to attack six towns along Cape Wrath before setting fires that spread through half the Rainwood - seemed to follow. The brave deeds of two royal daughters were now intertwined as Visenya used her strength and power to observe justice for a wronged sister against an enemy far away from home.
Visenya Targaryen returned flying to Sandstone. Accompanied by her brother, Aegon the Conqueror, they unleashed their dragons upon Vaith and Hellholt, burning them all to a crisp before they returned. Prince Nymor of Dorne called upon his vassals, such as Lord Oakheart and Uthor Uller as well as Lord Fowler and Lord Connington, to oppose them but it was too late - Queen Rhaenys and Queen Visenya with The Dragon riding atop had already struck fear in the hearts of many Dornishmen. Both Two Kings had allowed Vhagar’s fires to be loosed upon Sunspear, Lemonwood, Ghost Hill and the Tor; now hundreds were homeless due to the ravages of war that spread like wildfire from Sandstone to Vaith and Hellholt.
Ser Joffrey Dayne and his recently assembled army of Dornishmen had answered Lord Fowler's call to arms, leading an army through the Prince's Pass and into the Reach to retake Nightsong. The combined forces of Addam Hightower, Ser Addam Hightower, Lord Caron and Garmon proved too strong for Lord Fowler; they burned a dozen villages, captured Nightsong and the surrounding lands with relative ease. Dayne was swift to follow up on their success, burning fields and farms for twenty leagues around Oldtown as he anticipated that Lord Hightower would answer him in kind by sending his son to retake Nightsong. Little could be done however; the Dornish force had melted back into the mountains before any retribution could be carried out.
Lord Manfred Hightower, the Old Lord of High Tower and father to Ser Addam, died soon after. King Aegon had already sent an army through the Prince’s Pass and into the Reach but when Lord Manfred passed away all he wanted was for his son to soar on Balerion and retake Nightsong in answer for his death. All of Westeros seemed to anticipate that a third Dornish army might come down from Starfall headed towards Oldtown. In response, King Aegon flew Balerion to High Garden, where he would contemplate another invasion of Dorne with Lords Tyrrell and Oakheart. But it proved too strong a foe as they overwhelmed Prince Nymor's men which lead to an attack on the Foothills villages up to the Red Mountains while at they same time burned fields, farms, and villages for twenty leagues around the city.  Despite their efforts however Slew Lord Hightower’s Younger son Garmon when boy led sortie against them; this also resulted in The Dragon’s forces putting castle High Tower to torch and its garrison to sword afterwards captives were carried back swiftly back unto Dorne before melting back into mountains again until next year.
The Fall of Dorne marked the end of House Targaryen’s brief dominion over Westeros; King Aegon and his sister-wives Visenya and Rhaenys descended with their dragons Vhagar and Meraxes, unleashing fire and blood upon the lands that stood in their way. The hellfire brought by Vhagar fell upon Skyreach while Meraxes flew to Starfall. Old Lord Fowler met a fiery fate in Hellholt when the full grown Firewyrm flew through his castle gates. When the Dragonlords eventually returned once more to Highgarden they suffered little harm, but this triggered Lord Manfred Hightower to cry out for vengeance against them. Exactly one year later King Aegon rode Balerion back towards Dorne to contemplate another invasion, bringing an end to a valiant response from lords far across Westeros as Ser Addam lifted Young Lord Theo Tyrell on top of him as Mor Greyjoy watched on with mortal agony painted across his face - all caught in the grip of Segson's Harder Than Steel Summer Campaign.
Rhaenys Targaryen and Aegon I, the Two Kings of Westeros, had set their sights on Hellholt in Dorne. With Vhagar and Meraxes unleashed upon its walls, they brought fire and blood to the ancient stronghold. Though there was terrible loss at the Fall of Dorne, Rhaenys suffered little harm but unknowingly triggered a darker fate for Aegon as he had been caught by one of the full-grown Qorgyle spearmen which held his sword harder than steel amidst his mortal agony. Now as they journey towards Hellholt once more to lose or perish in yet another dragon-fueled conquest, only time will tell if House Targaryen's fate follows that of Harren the Black's.
The mighty dragons Balerion, Vhagar and Meraxes flew fearlessly in the sky bringing destruction and chaos wherever they roamed. Lord Fowler, Lord Vaith Lady Toland, the Lords of Hellholt and many others became aware of this destruction which ultimately lead to mass panic throughout Dorne. The dragons burned Hellholt three times over leaving it fused into glass while their riders forced two other lords into hiding due to their brutality. Each one was murdered one after the other; King Aegon even offered a lord's ransom for those who could capture them all; however, Lord Connington lost his life whilst hunting, Lord Mertyns was poisoned with his whole household after a wine cask's arrival as well as Lord Fell who met his fate when smothered in a brothel. Finally feeling Dragon’s Wroth they had become hot blooded criminals by nightfall collecting their rewards from whoever can offer on land or sea across Westeros .
Queen Visenya Targaryen had had enough. She felt the Dragon’s Wrath coursing through her, hot and bloody. Everywhere around King's Landing her family was being attacked thrice, whilst the people of Westeros were exempt from suffering the same at all. Her brother Aenys and sister Rhaenys were slain one after other, their ennemies cut down in powerful force or forced into hiding as soon as moneyed rewards for Dornish lords' heads were offered. From Burned castles in Dorne three times over, to fused Sands of Hellholt into glass in places — the whole region itself had become a symbol of destruction along with murdering four Lords of the Hellholt, collecting rewards for their heads by Gold Ransom., Death of Lord Connington while hunting and poisoning Lord Mertyns and his household by wine cask — it seemed there was no end to it! Finally on one fateful night they set upon a smothered death to Lrd Fell in a brothel at dawn that broke Queen Visenya’s heart beyond repair. From that day forth she swore vengeance on anyone who wronged House Targaryens or endangered people under her care.
Ser Jon Cafferen, Wyl of Wyl and Alys Oakheart arrived uninvited at the Old Oak wedding of Lord Oakheart. Unaware that Targaryens had been attacking the area thrice and fallen slain after being cut down one night, they slayed Lord Oakheart and most of the wedding guests. Ser Jon gelded her husband and took turns raping Lady Alys and her handmaids before carrying them off to a Myrish slaver in Fawnton. Uthor Uller, son of Lord Toland or Harlan Tyrell of Highgarden could have come to their rescue but Queen Visenya's power exempted them from rescuing so terribly oppressed people.
The prince had been sent a warning of the impending doom to Dorne as he watched his beloved kingdom, House Martell, beset by famine, plague and blight. Despite his efforts, Meria Martell remained in her smoking desert of a kingdom until Queen Visenya Targaryen arrived with an even more destructive force - they called it the Blasted land. However, the loyal noblemen and women of the House Martell stood Unbowed, Unbent and Unbroken. With an unwavering sense of duty and dedication to their lord, they followed him into battle against all odds despite knowing that any victory was almost certainly impossible.
Meria Martell, the last of her name and ruler of House Martell had succeeded Lord Nymor, who in his day had been determined to return the skull of the dragon Meraxes back to King Aegon in order to broker terms of peace with House Targaryen. But Meria's plans were different; She sent her nephew Deria to Sunspear and offered King Aeogon a much more intimate delivery - The Yellow Toad from Dorne itself. When she died abed in Kings Landing, it was left up to Prince Nymor and Princess Deria to keep their Lady's promise, and so they set off for Free Cities amidst smokey desert of Blasted land beset by famine plague and blight that has remained Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken since Aegon I targaryens' conquest.
Prince Nymor was one of many to express strong opposition when Queen Visenya argued for suggesting peace terms to King Aegon Targaryen. But the Lord Oakheart and Orys Baratheon dismissed these suggestions, voicing the hard and bitter sentiment that Deria's father, Prince Nymor had been pressing for since his mother Meria Martell had died abed in Sunspear. However Lord Fowler butted in saying it would be meanest thing since The Yellow Toad of Dorne if Prince Nymor meant to send a stalwart rider like Ser addon Hightower back with an offer King Aegon could not accept.
When King Aegon Targaryen heard Rhaenys' suggestion of granting peace to the Dornishmen without demanding their submission, he faced bitter opposition from the Lords of Small Council. Lord Oakheart argued that it was too soon and that it would only encourage fresh rebellions, but Queen Visenya dismissed them strongly. With a heavy heart she agreed with her sister, daring anyone to suggest otherwise and refusing to forget how their beloved mother had suffered grievously during her campaign in Dorne. Aegon's brother Prince Nymor was cautious about granting forgiveness so easily but agreed for the good of his beloved kingdom. Lucan Tyrell, Lord of Highgardeners from Reach and Harlan Tyrell from The Marches joined in unison; joining Lucan they said they were weary after all these years and dared any opposition to stand in their way since they had all suffered greatly by now.
Princess Deria of the Reach and daughter of Steffon Sunderland had been sent to King's Landing on her father's orders with a sealed letter. The king had heard tales of the brave deeds of Princess Deria and how she had suffered grievously at the hands of both Lord Oakheart and Uthor Uller. On arrival, she presented him with the sealed letter, reflecting her noble selfless nature. The lords of small council could draw their own conclusions as to why a princess from the previously war-torn land would be making such an appearance in King’s Landing, but it was unclear what she sought from them though one thing was sure; her bravery in coming forward knew no bounds—the courage that defined house Targaryen from days gone by still flowed through her veins like wildfire.
King Aegon seated on the Iron Throne rose and said to his assembled court “I have read Prince Nymor’s words, and I shall now burn the letter and never speak of it again.” He then mounted Balerion and flew off across the Blackwater Bay, returning not two days later with a treaty of eternal peace signed between Dorne and King Aegon. All those present were silent at this unexpected show of allegiance from Princess Deria; even Lord Oakheart, Uthor Uller and Lord Toland, who had been sceptical earlier in the day, could only nod in agreement.
The war had lost its savour, and all the lords and noble knights in King Aegon's court were weary of conflict. All that remained was a plea for peace - which brought Queen Rhaenys Targaryen to her feet. Deria, the Yellow Toad of Dorne, suggested a simple but heartfelt letter be written outlining their terms of peace - even if it meant resisting every malign angle put forward by Lord Fowler, Lord Oakheart and Uthor Uller. Although King Aegon and his loyal lords agreed, they could not help but fear the consequences should Prince Nymor rose in open court as he had before and said something else entirely. In the end, they burned the letter before anyone could speak against it; chose stonfaced silence when asked; returned each drop of blood spilt with resolve to resist any further aggression.
Grand Maester Clegg came to King's Landing with a desperate plea from Prince Nymor, who had threatened Dorne if Queen Rhaenys refused to come and engage in war. Queens Rhaenys and Aenys arrived at the court with their family in tow - eager to see what their beloved king would say on this matter. Despite his heartfelt plea of how many people would be lost if they were to resist this suggestion, King Aegon's answer was a simple "No". His resolve caused the noble knights and lords to feel a certain malign at Prince Nymor for seeking battle when it could have been avoided.
Oberyn Martell, the Red Viper of Sunspear, was a renowned warrior and ardent opponent of the Targaryen Dynasty. During the First Dornish War (4–13 AC), his impressive battle technique earned him much respect in King's Landing; however reluctantly it may have been from Queen Rhaenys, Aenys and Grand Maester Clegg. Though he refused to engage any more than necessary on account of his ties to Dorne and its people, Oberyn ultimately killed many Westerosi would-be conquerors when they threatened his home. With no other option but desperate warfare against the Iron Throne’s forces, Oberyn led a rebellion force through disparate lands like Braavos, Highgardeners and Lords in fierce battles -all without losing sight of great victory an securing peace eventually for his nation which had been ravaged by wars so long before.
The Yellow Toad of Dorne's story was well known throughout Westeros and beyond, often told in hushed whispers. During the First Dornish War (4–13 AC) he fought beside Prince Nymor against Harren the Black and Two Kings, Torrhen Stark and Aegon Targaryen. He was renowned for his courage and skill; witness to him alone facing down an entire Lannister company at Red Mountains. Meria wrote that she had never seen a person fight with such 'dishonorable scorn' as The Yellow Toad, mocking his enemy even in battle. His actions were said to have been a deciding factor behind Dorne becoming 'defeated', yet he was seen to be honourable by those who knew him until the very end.
Aegon the Conqueror had soon returned to King's Landing and claimed his right to sit on the Iron Throne. After a long wait, he acceded to the throne, ready for whatever future may come. His younger brother, Harren the Black, led Aegon's troops in battle against Dornish opposition during the conflict known as Aegon's Conquest. The Two Kings of Dorne were defeated and dethroned by Harren, however Meria Martell - a Yellow Toad of Dorne - was seen to behonorable despite scorn from mocking lords of small council in Kings Landing. Now Aegon reigned with bloodthirsty tyranny; his sister-wives Rhaenys and Visenya at his side. In their wake lay many dishonorable acts that would leave Westeros forever changed by House Targaryen.
