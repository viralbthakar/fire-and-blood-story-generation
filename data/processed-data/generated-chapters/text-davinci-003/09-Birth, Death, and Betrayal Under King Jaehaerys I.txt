Jaehaerys I Targaryen and his father, Aegon the Conqueror had just returned from their first royal progress. Making stops at the Iron Throne, Dragonstone and the Red Keep along the way, Jaehaerys was determined to prove that he could be a good king like his father. He spent long days guesting and holding audience with restless smallfolk as a way of announcing that he was following in Aegon’s footsteps. On their return to Dragonstone, they were greeted by Ser Myles Smallwood and Lord Velaryon at the docks. Lord Velaryon said they should take some time to rest before embarking on another journey. However, Jaimehaerys had bigger plans. With a small gathering of lords and ladies including Prudence Celtigar and Septa Ysabel present in Maegor Towers, he declared that he would visit far-off lands such as Sunspear or The Arbor to find new allies for his soon-to-be kingdom. When all agreed upon it, Jaehaerys knew this decision would change everything following him forever.
Aegon the Conqueror was never shy about taking his royal visits, either. He'd been known to come suddenly-- emerging into a manor hall or marketplace and causing everyone he encountered to behold him with as much awe and respect as ever. During his time visiting for long enough, Aegon was always known to feed the locals and go hunting near by before finding himself impoverished from all the grand hospitality of those rich lords who had drunk dry their cellar of wine during the feast that preceded him. As such, wherever Aegon went-- so did lasting impressions of which were surefire proof that he had been seen by all.
Jaehaerys was appointed to accompany his grandfather Aegon the Conqueror on his royal visits, despite being younger in age. Despite being smaller and of lesser wealth than the other lords he met, Jaehaerys's progress was grand and rich. Everywhere they went the people fed them famously, taking whatever resources necessary so as not to have their visitors behold a poor house - for some even providing enough wine for Aegon to drink their reserves dry. As they rode through villages both large and small; shorter roads and longer ones in between; Jaehaerys wondered what it would be like if one day he were king himself. He found himself imagining who might accompany him then or how they could spend months riding across meadows and woods to go hunting together – something only kings could do!
Jaehaerys and Queen Alysanne had begun their first progress, commencing from King's Landing and proceeding north to Stokeworth, Rosby and the Vale of Arryn. Adored by all they had viewed, it was a joyous time as they shared modest meals with humble villagers while also taxing fishing spots further north along the coast. As they rode into Duskendale, Lord Darklyn offered to accompany them throughout the remainder of their larger tour when compared to Jaehaerys' shorter visits in previous years. They accepted his kind offer and eagerly anticipated what added pleasures his presence may bring to their journey.
King Jaehaerys and Queen Alysanne continued their journey as they went to Maidenpool, a town near Bay of Crabs. Lord Mooton greeted the royal couple with hospitality when they reached and the queen was so delighted that she wished for an afternoon swim at Wickenden, a village near Gulltown located in the Vale of Arryn. At Wickenden, she slipped away from her bodyguards accompanied by Florian the Fool, Jonquil Darke, Edyth  Lannister, Lyra Redwyne and Septa Ysabel instead of taking them along for safety reasons. When they reached there under Lady Mooton's guidance it was already evening time but nobody wanted to leave this blessed place as everyone enjoyed bathing together in pure water underneath a starlit sky speaking about life's sacred purposes.
Queen Alysanne and her entourage had finally reached the Starry Sept after a long journey. As soon as they arrived, Jaehaerys and Jonquil won over most of the Faithful with their winning words, convincing them that they had come in good faith and would not be polluted by their presence. With one hand on Jonquil's shoulder, Queen Alysanne led the procession inside. But there were those who were hard with hate towards her and to prevent danger, she slipped out of her clothing into the holy waters of Jonquil's Pool in secret. There was no doubt now - little queen had won the hearts of The Most Devout and she defiantly told one another "I will have my son confirmed as king!" from behind concealed walls.
Queen Alysanne, who had won over most of the Faithful that day at Starry Sept with her pious speeches and wise words, was taken to a bathhouse for rest by Septa Edyth and Prudence Celtigar. However, little did she know how vulnerable she still was in this moment - the woman's hard hate still bare beneath the surface - so when Ser Joffrey Doggett and Ser Gyles Morrigen side by side blessedly slashed and stabbed at her until they proved victorious in bringing down all of their target; nothing seemed capable of stopping them.
The Kingsguard arrived at the bathhouse with Queen Alysanne in tow, and made short work of the attackers, who had expected to find a more vulnerable target. Two were slain out of hand and one was hung for their attempted assault. Prudence Celtigar, Lord Mooton's right-hand woman, revealed to them that there had been plans of an attack in motion - which, thankfully never came to fruition due partly due to Ser Gyles Morrigen's wise intervention. The guilty were brought justice as they were hanged by Septa Edyth upon the order of the Queen - she did not hesitate when it proved necessary.
Jaehaerys and Queen Alysanne were met with a hero's welcome when they arrived at the Vale after the visit to the Vale was postponed. The Scarlet Shadow, Jonquil Darke and His Grace, Lord Donnel Darklyn, had accepted to be their guards from Maegor’s Holdfast all the way to Duskendale. They were flying furiously towards accepting Vulture Kings as their allies for intervention. Lord Mooton was livid of leal valiants made short work of his lord's killers, having hanged them guilty for planing an attack that failed but ended in slaying two out of hand.
After the visit to the Vale was postponed, Jaehaerys and Queen Alysanne returned from Duskendale to Maidenpool. They had received word that Queen Alyssa was with child, a wondrous event unexpected for someone well beyond her childforty-four years of age. The miracle caused many throughout the Reach and beyond to proclaim their devotion to the King. Lord Velaryon summoned his Kingsguard, Ser Myles Smallwood, Prudence Celtigar, Septa Ysabel to guard them during the journey back to Storm's End and then Oldtown. As news of their return spread like wildfire through dragonstone yards and Maegor Towers alike, people murmured that it must have been Dragonsword upon them which made it possible - Benifer or Septa Maryam perhaps who suffered an attack while they were away. Meanwhile in Dragonstone Lady Alayne Royce shouted praises for Jaehaerys' long reign as she joined Vhagar with Silverwing on a flight over Blackwater Bay towards Maidenpool.
Alyssa and Lord Rogar married, and soon after their marriage she was pregnant. To the joy of many, she gave birth to a robust and healthy infant - none other than King Aenys, with his jet-black hair clearly rebuking boremund's repented dornish sin. For forty-four years of age, well beyond her childbearing years, it was a wondrous and unexpected miracle. When word returned to Maidenpool from Storm’s End that Queen Alyssa had received a proclamation from Oldtown announcing the birth of Vaella's son most saw this as proof that 'The Stranger' truly had blessed Dorne.
Queen Alysanne had been overjoyed when she heard of the birth of her grandson, Prince Aegon, at Maidenpool. Her son Jaehaerys and daughter-in-law Vaella were both satisfied with the healthy and robust baby that was brought to them in Jonquil's Pool. However, despite being thankful for the delivery that Queen Alysanne gave, her joy turned to sorrow when she heard of his death only a few days later. The much lamented prince died from an undisclosed illness which left King Aenys distraught and repenting his sins while Lady Elissa Farman blamed herself as she was the midwife who delivered him. While all suffered during this event, not many were aware of another addition coming into existence in Redfort at Dragonstone – the star-crossed lovers Androw Farman and Lyra happened to be providing each with an abundance of comfort during this time.
Prince Rhaena Targaryen had been deeply affected by Prince Aegon's death, and so she requested to be taken to Dragonstone where she lay for weeks on end. With the council established there, King Jaehaerys sought her out during this time, but unfortunately was received coldly and eventually turned away. He left Dragonstone heavy-hearted as his daughter grieved in peace within its small neighboring walls.
Queen Rhaena and her younger sister, Aerea had gone to King's Landing in search of reunion. They had no memory of the place they had never visited nor any fondness for it. But when their arrival was praised and loved by the high and low birth within the Red Keep, none could terrorize them with fear like two queens from queer foreign lands. Knights came gallant, bedmaids curtseyed and even stableboys seemed vied for her favor. Rhaena felt oddly at home yet there was a heavy feeling inside as if she'd been turned away before - just like when she laid established on Dragonstone only to be received coldly and sought out love from Jaehaerys who turned away from her in cruelty.
When Aerea and Elissa Farman arrived at Dragonstone, they found the atmosphere different from what they had experienced in King's Landing. In the capital city, there was always a hustle and bustle of life but here on the island it seemed more subdued and quiet. Although people seemed to mingle around the -brood that had been brought into being with Queen Rhaena ruling over all, there was still something missing for Aerea having not seen her mother in years filled with no memory of her beloved queen nor any fondness for the Stern yet shy woman who had prayed she'd grant favor upon them when she was declared alive again. It wasn't like King's Landing where people were abundantly ready to love and praise her for every deed great or small; here even those who vied for her favor terrorized others from queer foreign lands whilst gallant knights including bedmaids and stableboys born of high and low birth alike ran far too often missed amid such certain dullness that made sleep almost seem desirable an opportunity.
Princess Aerea Targaryen, Vhagar and Silverwing accompanied their mother Rhaena to the hatching of eggs that Dreamyfre had laid on Fair Isle. She urged her brother, Lord Daemon Velaryon, to visit with them at Dragonstone as she felt lacking without him there. As the hatchlings emerged from the shells and dragons were born, a great, dangerous and terrifying display played out before them. Little did they know what was to come next as they mingle with distant kings and star-crossed lovers in the yards of Dragonmont's hidden caves on the far side of the mountain.
Princess Aerea was delighted when she and Dragonstone arrived at King's Landing. Though the journey had been long and dangerous, nothing could dampen her enthusiasm as she arrived to hatch eggs that Dreamfyre had laid on Fair Isle. Overcome by a sense of adventure, she urged Rhaena Targaryen to join her in exploring the great citadel. Rhaena shared Aerea’s enthusiastic attitude about sightseeing, and eagerly accepted the invitation, quickly enlisting her friend Elissa Farman for company. The three companions happily explored the Red Keep and even ventured up to Dragonmont atop Vhagar or Silverwing - whichever mount could fly them farthest from home – and loved every second of their escapades together.
King Jaehaerys, Queen Visenya and Queen Alysanne made a grand Progress through the Vale of Arryn in 52 AC. Accompanied by their retinue, including Lord Grafton, Lady Prudence Celtigar and her handmaid Benifer; they visited places such as Runestone, Redfort, Longbow Hall as well as Heart’s Home and Gates of the Moon where women's court was held. They stopped at Gulltown where the betrothal of Lady Prudence Celtigar to Lord Grafton was arranged. It is said that King Jaehaerys called out to Vhagar which had been accompanying them on the aerial journey with his beloved queen Aerea mounted atop it calling "Fly far my love". During his stay here he also heard tales about star-crossed lovers Rhaena Targaryen and Ser Myles Smallwood; learning about their courage in the face of danger.
Queen Alysanne, King Jaehaerys and her children Visenya and Rhaenys arrived in the majestic Vale of Arryn. They passed through Redfort, Longbow Hall and Heart’s Home as they rode their dragons towards Runestone. Despite the correct proclamation issued by the king earlier, an enormous crowd had gathered to see them fly across the moonlit sky with their banners unfurling behind them. In Runestone they were met with praise from locals and nobility alike. All heard how Queen Alysanne was determined to make sure that every child spoke properly without any sloppy or incorrect enunciation ever again. Young Lord Grafton of Gulltown could hardly hold his breath while Lady Prudence Celtigar watched from Farman with awe at such an enormous gesture made by a queen who deeply cared for her people's well being throughout Westeros.
Queen Alysanne had made aware the common plight of widows in the Seven Kingdoms- when a man perished, his heirs often set about stripping away prerogatives and reducing the widow to penury. After a time, some took second wives which only increased resentment for those who had been ousted from their homes. Queen Alyssa was thus witness to many expulsions from various households, eagerly striping away prerogatives and reducing her to little more than a boarder. Her grace felt deeply for these women and dispatched agents throughout the realm so she might better understand how widows were treated across all corners of Westeros.
King Jaehaerys promulgated the Widow's Law, requiring that a woman driven by her husband’s death not be left exposed and deprived of her rights. It disinherited any eldest surviving son if his father were to after a time take second wives - something Alysanne had made aware would often lead to resentment from the man toward his widow, who he was then apt to try and expel or strip away of means, reducing her to little more than a boarder in their own home. Lord Velaryon traveled widely throughout the Seven Kingdoms, alerting lords and ladies high and low so that no one might argue ignorance of the King's law; with Lord Myles Smallwood supporting him- they even managed to convince Prudence Celtigar of Dragonstone who had long been reluctant towards change. Septa Ysabel lent her moral guidance in favor of its adoption while Lady Alayne Royce welcomed it as a long denied justice for those bereaved. Queen Alyssa Targaryen decreed formal acceptance on behalf within their castles right alongside Jaehaerys himself- lending solemn conviction behind it all- and soon like wildfire it moved through all corners of Westeros until such horrors as Alysanne endured were neveragain permitted.
King Jaehaerys's decree of Widow's Law had been promulgated, which required his subjects to be driven by honor, not deprived of it when it came to disinheriting their eldest surviving sons. With such ambition in mind, His Grace continued his work at Dragonpit as springing up around Aegon's High Hill and the Hill of Rhaenys. But when he visited King’s Landing for the first time since the law was passed on, what he saw was lamentably close to a dark and filthy city coiled with poverty and despair.
Jaehaerys stood in the city, watching as his orders were fulfilled. He'd decreed for styes and hovels to be knocked down and for a central square to be carved out, a space where empties could be planted with massive trees and long-neglected streets widened, straightened, and cobbled anew. The King looked upon the worst of the dark places he'd visited including the Hill of Rhaenys and what had been springing up around at Aegon's High Hill with lamentable closeness. Whatever was being built on his command would be great—Wide enough roads to march troops through in formation; high wide trees shading more than half of each street; bright polished stones forming walls that kept the filth coiled away into one corner of town.
As the city was rebuilt by Lord of Air Rego Draz and Pentoshi master of coin according to their king’s command, their rebuilding effort had rapidly began to put a strain on the city's coffers due to its cost. Many had started to take notice, growing ever more hostile towards those in power at the king’s expense. The lord flaunted his wealth gained from taking gold from the witless king—the consequential popularity for these acts being one so damnedly unpopular it was almost unheard of. Furthermore, some believed that such corrupt dealings with godless queer intrigues as great with child Queens as well as swollen breasts befitting more an old bat'shead could not possibly be tolerated. People began to resent how easily he seemed to snatch up golden coins left and right, never questioning if it truly did belong solely and wholly in his hands .
Lord Rego Draz, the Lord of Air and master of King's Landing's reconstruction, reluctantly imposed an assessment on Pentos in order to be able to collect the funds he needed for his new arrangement. Having already brought such strain upon the city due to his increased demands laid out by rebuilding King’s landing, tension was even further heightened when their heavily assessed taxes were flaunted at court. This consequential unpopularity only seemed to make him more corrupt in the eyes of those watching—straining relations between Pentos and its godless queer yet great with child who bore swollen breasts not seen since “the bat’shead rebellion” so many years ago could be clearly sensed amidst resented whispers throughout Dragonpit and King's Landing alike.
Queen Alysanne and King Jaehaerys were touring the realm on their royal progress when they reached Dragonstone. Queen Alysanne, with child and determined to remain at Dragonstone until she gave birth, soon drew the attention of Lord Rego Draz, who had been tasked by her husband before his passing to ensure any taxes imposed were assessed fairly. With a lacklustre collection of funds brought in and a strained relationship with newly appointed lords, Queen Alysanne reluctantly increased taxes to better serve the people - heavy though the measure may have seemed. Along for this journey was Septa Maryam, Benifer her Kingsguard, Lord Velaryon their honored guest Ser Myles Smallwood atop Braavar's Pride, Prudence Celtigar from House Pepperking greeted them fruitfully at The Three Towers; Supta Ysabel greeted those of them coming to Starry Sept near Gods Eye in order to bless the union between these two star-crossed lovers.
King Jaehaerys and Queen Alysanne had set out on a royal progress early in the new year, with their nine-year-old daughter, Lady Jennis Templeton. They did so with best wishes from King's Landing and headed to Harrenhal as guests of its new lord. From there, the royal court moved on to Riverrun, Acorn Hall, Pinkmaiden, Atranta and finally Stoney Sept. Being with child at the time created some difficulties but Queen Alysanne insisted that any issues were minor ones compared to what it meant for her people -- a long period of plentiful peace and prosperity. On each stop they made along the way they received extravagant welcomes from proud lords eager to demonstrate both their loyalty to House Targaryen and skill in throwing festivals full of pageantry in honor of their sovereigns. As such festivities carried on each night under starry skies, King Jaehaerys would often take to the sky again on Vermithor while Queen Alysanne began holding women’s courts in her place – much like those organized by her mother before her - that decried injustice across regions visited by them. Meanwhile she remained firmly rooted in duty at Red Keep when not traveling; presiding over council meetings and holding audience from a velvet seat at base of Iron Throne behind which stood ever-watchful eyes of Kingsguard led by Lord Velaryon alongside Ser Myles Smallwood whose swift counsel saved many a situation during tumultuous years that followed fall of Aegon Targaryen conqueror months after birth of his heir Aegon who perished defending him later only at Kings' Landing battlefield unceremoniously known as 'Battle Beneath The Stars'.
Her Grace Daemon Velaryon and his beloved wife grew great with child before the year’s end. After delivering of a handsome, healthy and nobly named Corlys in Blackwater Bay, presented for announcement to the citizens Gullet, Lord Donnel Hightower and Driftmark. Benifer, Septa Maryam and her Kingsguard cousin Ser Myles Smallwood attended the occasion – Lord Donnel's brother filled up as Captain of her guard too. Queen Alysanne was present at this joyous occasion too..
Queen Daenerys was brought to Stoney Sept, where she followed with king Jaehaerys and his court. The moment of birth was close at hand; the queen doted on her unborn child and everyone in the palace hoped for a strong and healthy babe. When the time finally came to present the baby, they saw that she had grown great with Child as noble, handsome, and healthy as could be. They named him accordingly - after his father King Jaehaerys -  mounted their dragons Vhagar, Silverwing and Dreamfyre, flew from Stoney Sept to King’s Landing to Dragonstone showing off their bundle of joy. All along their route the people cheered for this queen who had so duely brought about such a grand heir to her husband’s throne.
The birth of Princess Rhaena, the younger sister of Aerea Targaryen and Aegon the Uncrowned, was remembered even years later. Displaced from their Iron Throne due to her strong-willed, bold-tongued and fiery nature, both Aerea and Aegon had been brought to Stoney Sept by King Jaehaerys before being flown away to King's Landing due to Maeger’s attack. Queen Daenerys hoped for a healthy baby but when it seemed to be due soon she had her own dragon Vhagar mount her towards Dragonstone with his dragonmount friend Silverwing following closely behind. With the news that Maester Benifer delivered at Dragonstone about princesses birth everyone in court doted upon her Princess Aerea whom they adored like their own child.
Queen Rhaena, Elissa Farman and Lord Franklyn stood together in the great hall of Fair Isle overlooking the Sunset Sea. The rift that had opened between Elissa and Queen Rhaena following her birth of Princess Aerea had long since been shared over, held by a powerful bond between the two women. As they spoke, it was clear to all who witnessed them that something special connected them - something even stronger than their beloved dragons Vhagar and Silverwing. Asking Lord Franklyn to build a ship so they could sail away anytime they wished, they were dismayed when he denied their reasonable request outright. No longer standing as close as before, Queen Rhaena channeled her strong-willed personality as she boldly spoke out against him with fiery words. Though it seemed like an ending for these star-crossed lovers, only time would tell if this chapter would prove to be simply another chapter on their closest way to happily ever after.
Queen Rhaena, Elissa Farman and Lord Franklyn had just returned from the Conclave, where Jaehaerys I Targaryen had looked back on history and realised that the year of the stranger was marked by death, division and disaster. Little did anyone know what was to come in Fair Isle when the rift opened between Elissa and Queen Rhaena or how Lord Franklyn would deny them their incomes. Now that they had been sent away with no option but to build a ship on Sunset Sea and sail to their destinies, all they shared were feelings of an ominous future full of difficult times. As they parted ways with their beloved Queen, a feeling of darkness blanketed them like never before. Who could have predicted that this dark night would be one of the darkest moments in Westerosi history?
As Queen Regent, Septon Oswyck had overseen the interment of Jaehaerys I Targaryen at Dragonstone. The old man's passing marked a troubled end to an era of difficult history and hindsight of what saw in his lifetime only reminded him of the darkest times - death, division and disaster. As he passed through the yards of Dragonstone, he realized it would be Alysanne who must take up King's Hand now that Jaehaerys was gone. It was her brother as much as any, who held firm to these old walls even in failing days; she had it within her to carry on his legacy no matter how ominous the winds may howl.
Queen Alyssa, Grand Maester Benifer and Septon Barth had made their way from the Red Keep to Storm’s End in order to deliver the news of King Jaehaerys' passing. Oswyck was already there mourning his longtime friend and arranged for a proclamation of news from Storm’s End. As Boremund Baratheon questioned the motives of those around him, Rogar Baratheon cautioned that now was not the time for such inquiries as they were still in midst of mourning. Despite all this, Grand Maester Benifer insisted on delivering the astonishing news; They were witnesses to a second miracle—the birth of twin dragons at Dragonstone! The elated crowd immediately offered up prayers to lend favor with both gods and dragons alike.
The lady Elissa Farman had arrived at Dragonstone to say her farewells, but Queen Rhaena and Princess Aerea did not receive her as regally as she would have hoped. They could tell from the somber expression on Lady Elissa's face that she was suffering; yet despite this, the Queen remained stone-faced, restrained in her composure. Not wanting to show any emotion to their guest, both of them called for their ladies-in-waiting whilst pleading for time alone with Elissa. Tears soon started streaming down Elissa's cheeks as she clung onto Rhaena and Aerea begging not to be sent away just yet. Even through a thin veil of tears, they could see the sorrow in her eyes emanating like a beacon in smoke-filled sky - an emotional dusk of sand settling over the Stone Drum yard. Pulling back gently they bid Lady Elissa Farman a tearful goodbye, wishing that their paths would cross again one day - unaware that history was going to write those same words into legend far sooner than anyone had realized.
Lady Elissa Farman bid her farewells to Queen Rhaena and Princess Aerea of Dragonstone, departing for Driftmark with a heavy heart. With three dragon eggs missing, she took ship across the narrow sea to Pentos and made her way overland to Braavos in search of answers with the help of Ser Merrell Bullock, one of the King'sguard. During their journey many perilous dangers lay ahead of them as well as strange and mysterious allies who could guide them on their quest towards finding the missing eggs.
Wounded from her betrayal, Rhaena Targaryen hid and ordered Ser Merrell and Ser Alyn to take Princess Aerea with them to Driftmark. Her cousin Androw Farman, accompanied by Lady Elissa, was commanded by his king to expel the princess from Pentos on a ship across the Narrow Sea. The questioning proved fruitless as denials were made in regards to the missing three dragon eggs. Rhaena watched as they departed for Driftmark with a great fury in her heart that only intensified when summoned by the Lord of Dragonstone demanding answers. She reluctantly sailed back with them, but decided upon going cold instead once they went into hiding on an island in Braavos.
Rhaena Targaryen had finally arrived to the Red Keep after being summoned by her brother, Jaehaerys I Targaryen. She was accompanied by Grand Maester Benifer and her half-brother Aenys. As they entered the throne room, Rhaena's fury was evident as she crossed an accusing gaze at all present. They had been called in to discuss Elissa's theft of dragon eggs from Dragonstone and if she could be brought to justice or if they would have wash their hands off this incident. Jaehaerys offered a proposition - he'd give them to Rhaena and she'd go across the continent travelling through Pentos and Tyrosh, Myr adn Free Cities even Yi Ti if necessary, bring back the stolen eggs or bring back news of their whereabouts so that action can be taken against those who stole them peacefully with no violence involved for he thought it too weak for his indecisive nature refused bloodshed in such matters .
Rhaena Targaryen had mounted her dragon Silverwing, against the cautioning of Grand Maester Benifer. Waging War Across Narrow Sea was the only thing that Rhaena knew could help bring peace to Westeros. With Queen in the East and Visenya backing her, she soared out over the Valyrian sea towards Volantis to demand their return of what Elissa had stolen from them - dragon eggs. If they offered them peacefully then great, but if not, Rhaena would have to take them back by force no matter how weak or indecisive they were. Praying that this journey would end better than it begun, she silently bore forward with a newfound determination
The rumor of Rego Draz, a thief from Dragonstone, had spread far and wide in the Narrow Sea and reached even distant places such as Volantis. The tale was known to be true by common knowledge, as Grand Maester Benifer paid out hefty sums to Pay Rhaena’s brother, Rogar, for his theft after reaching small islands across the sea. Eventually with the advice of Lord Velaryon, Queen in the East gathered her Kingsguard and sailed off towards Dragonstone; not knowing what awaited them on their journey or when they would return.
Lady Elissa had secured her freedom by taking on a new name and was now headed to Braavos. Having been disowned by her brother Lord Franklyn, she made her way and managed to secure an audience with the Sealord of Braavos. After spending weeks gathering funds from some of the wealthiest merchants, Lady Elissa was able to buy dragon eggs from mysterious traders in Fair Isle. With few resources available in Dragonstone, she used finances that had been entrusted to her for building of the Sun Chaser. Knowing that it wasn't quite enough for the project, Alys Westhill - a Pentosi merchant at Sea Dragon Tower -reluctantly agreed to finance more for them in return for Lady Elissa's glad tidings about his business reaching farwide places and paying him back as soon as possible. Despite rumors common among sailors and Folks of Seven Kingdoms being known about their plans, Lady Elissa remained narrow-minded and small in scale while starting their venture into dangerous waters.
King Jaehaerys, known as the Elder and beloved throughout Westeros, was headed to the Starry Sept of Oldtown with much concern from the High Septon. Suddenly he collapsed while ascending a flight of steps to his bedchamber and when it became know in the realm that he had reached his final destination dead before he reached the bottom, bells in every sept sang a dolorous song announcing that Father of the Faithful had gone to join the Seven. Queen Visenya sent her Kingsguard immediately on hearing news of fresh misfortune in Westeros, ordering them reinforce Lord Velaryon at Dragonstone, who will defend against any attackers alongside Lady Alayne Royce and Lady Prudence Celtigar.
An air of solemnity hung over Starry Sept as King Jaehaerys, His Holiness the High Septon, and the Most Devout of Westeros interred his body to rest in the sept near Red Keep's library. Despite much discussion amongst those present about choosing his successor, no one was able to convince His Holiness or persuade him to accept any other but Septon Barth - a man known for his devoutness and trusted by the young king before he passed away - despite being little-known outside the Seven Kingdoms. Even in death, he favoured an unorthodox approach; something which would have endeared him further with both religious followers and many commoners alike.
When King Jaehaerys had finished interring His Holiness, the Most Devout set out to convince and persuade the lords of the council to be choosing his successor. After arriving in King's Landing, Septon Mattheus was chosen as His Grace agreed upon it after all agreeing to do what is necessary to make certain that he would forgive and forget about their certain previous behavior.  Lord Daemon Velaryon was among those lords of the council who thought that this young and little known Septon could help heal their kingdom, with his unorthodox methods. He traveled from Dragonstone with Lady Alayne Royce and Queen Alyssa by his side in order assist him for this complicated task ahead.
The Oldtown citadel was abuzz as Queen Alysanne gathered Rego Draz, Daemon Velaryon, Qarl Corbray, Albin Massey, Septon Mattheus, Septon Barth and Grand Maester Benifer to discuss their plan. The queen proposed that they send a fleet to Dragonstone and hire mercenaries to defend the island from further attack. Rego suggested they might offer the same fate as that of High Septon who had caused so much trouble for King Aenys and King Maegor before him. While some advocated for such a show of force others like Lord Daemon rejected it out of fear for his leal subjects on Dragonstone yet the queen’s decision was laid in stone: well-placed hired fighters would be needed if they desired order restored in Westeros once more. As Jaehaerys japed in favour of his mother's decision even he could not have imagined just how far a simple show of force would take them all.
All the lords of the council made uneasy by Lord Donnel's suggestion that they hire a show of force to Oldtown and Maidenpool in retaliation for the same fate as the High Septon who had made such trouble for Aenys and Maegor. Septon Barth pointed out that Jaehaerys had offered to lead an army himself. Lady Alayne Royce reminded everyone that Maegor had also employed well-placed spies, as Queen Alysanne desired. But Lord Manfryd Redwyne insisted on a show of force, saying there was nothing better than dragons when it came to getting a message across. Japed Lord Daemon Velaryon, "but what happens when you need more leal supporters?". This caused both Septon Mattheus and Grand Maester Benifer to look horrified at his bent-backed figure - could he be suggesting warfare? The rest just exchanged uneasy glances; eager for someone else to decide how best to handle this situation, after all laying siege was not something any of them desired lightly.
Jaehaerys and his king made their way to Oldtown in order to try and convince the lords of the council to believe that they had justice on their side. No sooner had they arrived than Jaehaerys gave orders to bring forth Benifer - a renowned septa from Dragonstone - and Septa Maryam, her seat at The High Tower, in an effort to quell any unease present amongst the lords. Even this did not seem enough for Lord Donnel who insisted that Lady Alayne Royce and Queen Alyssa be there too- much to Jaeharys' worry.
As the sun set on Oldtown, the King and Queen took their leave after a long day of convencing his people to believe in his orders. They stopped at Bitterbridge for a night’s rest before continuing their flight towards King’s Landing. Accompanying them were Ser Joffrey Doggett, loyal to the throne, as well as Alysanne and Scarlet Shadow; two star-crossed lovers who had been bound by Jonquil Darke and Jaehaerys' handfasting ceremony. With each other for courage, they all made their way across Westeros with Maester Culiper taking lead of the mission through trading towns and hidden caves on the far side of mountains from Dragonstone to Highgarden.
Vermithor and Silverwing's arrival at Oldtown point blankly in the sky made the city gasp. It was unexpected, but as they alighted atop the Hightower, Jaehaerys and Septon Mattheus fanned the flames of gossip by their presence there. People were frightened; rumors began to spread rapidly that when Jaehaerys left King's Landing he would take what remained of his loyal houseguard Scarlet Shadow with him and fly to run away from Queen Alysanne in Oldtown. However, no one could have guessed that Vermithor and Silverwing had sent a pair of Septas ahead to make sure Lady Prudence Celtigar opened up Lord Hightower's court as well as prepared for such an unexpected landing.
As soon as the High Septon, His High Holiness, arrived in Oldtown with Queen Jaehaerys and Octon Mattheus by his side, the people of Oldtown cheered at their unexpected arrival. The procession made its way to Starry Sept where a somber funeral rite was taking place for Archmaester Goodwyn under the watchful eyes of Lord Donnel Hightower and Lady Elissa Farman. As Jaehaerys and the High Septon entered, they bowed their heads in respect before walking up to deliver a heart-wrenching eulogy that brought tears to all who were present. Before long it became clear that Queen Jaehaerys had no intention on leaving Oldtown anytime soon as she asked her Kingsguard to remain while they completed the Funeral rites in peace. Despite her sadness amid this tragic event, every time she nodded or gave an encouraging smile to those around her one could not help but feel huge sense of admiration for such character strength. 
Jaehaerys and Alysanne, having arrived in Oldtown just prior to the funeral rites at the Starry Sept, had nodded their approval as His High Holiness gave his eulogy. The huge crowd that had gathered cheered as they passed by the Archmaester Goodwyn into the waiting carriage. Now on their way to Lord Donnel’s Hightower, Queen Alysanne chatted away about recent events whilst Jaehaerys slept soundly. As night passed without incident and morning came all too soon for them both, what had once been a peaceful bus ride turned into farce as strange occurrences began to take place within their own carriage. With curtains firmly pulled closed around them- ostensibly so others could not spy upon them- it was only the two of them in there who witnessed these peculiar happenings!
Donnel Hightower arrived in Oldtown with his Brother, Nephew and Cousins to join the ancient and powerful Hightower family. The wealthy and proud family that had resided in Oldtown for centuries owned one of the tallest towers of Westeros. Later that night, much to Donnel's surprise, he was called by a Stranger to wear a crown in front of important lords and royal council members. His King blessed him as the newly appointed Lord of High Tower who would prove himself worthy enough like all his predecessors before him.
King Jaehaerys and his lords had gathered in the Starry Sept, just outside Oldtown to celebrate a grand feast. In attendance was His High Holiness, Lord Donnel and his four siblings, as well as Lord Hightower and Septon Mattheus. The occasion was to show that a sibling marriage must never again be questioned by the Starry Sept - something which reached far beyond their noble family’s low beginnings but praised them for the exceptionalist lineage they derived from the kings of Westeros; many were impressed with their power, wealth, and pride. Queen Alyssa Royce also attended, alongside her Kingsguard entourage including Maester Culiper to reach an agreement that all four ballots were unanimously required.
Alfyn had been standing with Lord Donnel and the rest of King Jaehaerys’s court when the fourth ballot was cast - a tie-breaker between his grace's queen, and a mysterious Stranger. Just as Alfyn feared, the result broke in favour of the Stranger. This fell like an axe amongst them all; it seemed their efforts to somehow reach a more aligned decision on that sibling marriage had proved futile. The situation then grew fiercer still as an oldest cousin of Donnel's spoke out against this new outcome. No sooner had he done so than a voice rose from amongst those gathered at Starry Sept: "Exceptionalist!" And thus ended the Great feast, from which nothing much was derived but some low noble pride. As Lord Donnel made his way back to Reach for another night under its dim stars, he took Alfyn along with him and told him about Queen Alysanne Velaeyon, his king's grandmother who once defined rights for star-crossed lovers everywhere –the youngest Targaryen Queen ascending to power long ago on Dragonstone, who strived harder but ruled no sooner than her father Maegor or her brother Aegon . He further praised her virtues, detailing how she led a conclave into Westeros' highborn halls in defiance of all those dragons and lords around her--a Fire blooded Pheonix crowned by might henceforth reigning fire over Westeros' lands far and wide..Together they thought upon these strings that bound one faction to another through such exceptional thoughts--but above all~those shared journeys & tales set inside each collective heart that make us stand firmer together yet dream higher & wider apart.
Septon Barth knew the bargain he had struck with Lord Donnel's brother was fraught with danger and corruption, but he believed in Alfyn and the quest he had been peddled. As they questioned why Ruded wanted them to succeed, the Septon wrote down his thoughts and hopes on a parchment while standing silently in agreement. During these times of turmoil, it was easy to take sides - some chose righteousness while others chose power. It would be up to Alfyn whether or not this noble journey was worthy of his time.
Septon Alfyn was astonished when Jaehaerys and Vermithor flew up to the sky. After reaching for him, they traveled by litter to Oldtown, visiting Bandallon, Three Towers, Uplands and Honeyholt. Along the way they encountered Prudence Celtigar who had come seeking Lord Velaryon's favors in Ashford; Ser Myles Smallwood which led a party of Kingsguard knights on Patrol near Stone Drum; Ser Merrell Bullock and Ser Joffrey Doggett at Dragonstone Castle fighting off attackers and her brother Rogar Baratheon allied with Lyman Lannister at Cassella Staunton's behest. Everywhere they went people stopped what they were doing just to marvel at Queen Alysanne riding on Vermithor's back with Rhaella seated beside her. When finally reached The Arbor, Septon Alfyn prayed solemnly alongside novices in their motherhouse before joining His High Holiness to meet Queen Alysanne in Citadel where she conversed about devout beliefs that made lords of council questioned if it is possible for corruption to be rooted out so easily into silent worshipers yet worthy of recognition by all kings.
The Queen and her Conclave of archmaesters had assembled in the Citadel's dining hall, feasting on a sumptuous feast while the most learned lectured those present on how to read, write and think. The Highborn youths not afraid of ravens were sent home; instead there was an effort to give girls a chance to learn. As they ate and discussed their passions, Queen Alysanne took her leave, commending them for their devotion before she left.
The High Septon has returned to Oldtown, joined by King Jaehaerys, Queen Alysanne and the Kingsguard. The party had followed a new course following the public ceremony duely anointed and consecrated in Starry Sept at the foot of Dornish Marches. Along their journey, they made stops in Stormlands, Horn Hill, Nightsong and Blackhaven where Benifer accompanied them along with Septa Maryam and her. Lord Velaryon and Ser Myles Smallwood were also part of the entourage whereas Lady Prudence Celtigar was left behind due to health concerns. When the court finally made it back to Oldtown, the Conclave assembled for a lecture in Citadel's dining hall as feasted upon fine foods; not afraid of ravens from Dragonstone who wanted to send home boys whilst give girls a chance as highborn women!
Queen Alysanne and Lord Dondarrion found themselves in the small and Modest town of Blackhaven, where they were welcomed as splendid hosts by Simon, a local lord. After having entertained them with song and story, they lingered for an especially congenial evening during which stories of star-crossed lovers between kings and qyeens had played out. As they returned to Storm's End, neither could know that the tales recounted that night would soon be echoed within their own lives; many moons later when Queen Alyssa took power it seemed that fate was inevitable long already had been chosen.
Vermithor and Silverwing wasted no time in taking to the skies, following their Lord Commander's charge of bringing the king and queen to their mother's side. Soon they were soaring over Stonehelm, Crow's Nest, and Griffin's Roost, cheered on by villagers who spotted the magnificent beasts in flight. As they descended closer to Stonehelm, Ser Gyles Morrigen could make out the great castle where Queen Alysanne had made her home until recently. The sight of it brought joy to his heart - a reminder that he was now on a mission from his king and queen - but also stirred within him unsettling images of Lady Alayne Royce and Queen Alyssa Baratheon conversing at court before war had engulfed this part of Westeros.
Lord Baratheon and the King's men, led by Durran Godsgrief, had paused outside Storm’s End where Prince Jaehaerys Targaryen confronted his father, Rogar. Riding Silverwing, they raised their swords in him honor while demanding he stand aside so they could fulfill the late Queen Alysanne's last wish- to bring her king and queen to her side at Stonehelm. They had discovered that something great and massive was swelling inside the castle tower but there were no signs of life until a deep growl rumbled in response. Alerted to danger beyond what any of them expected, Lord Baratheon and his men quickly followed behind Vermithor as King Jaehaerys climbed upon his dragon to investigate further with Lady Alayne Royce in tow.
The labor had begun, Queen Alyssa's moans tinged with moments of agony that set the midwife rushing to her side in solace. Maester Kyrie allowed for a brief pause as he explained what was happening. "Alysanne is strong," he added to confirm his earlier assumption and inspection; it seemed the child within was indeed fighting to come out, but the near-royal flesh of its mother's womb lay torn and dying - every bit o'due being brought up simply adding insult to already profound injury. Rhaena's brother growled silently in agreement among the Kingsguard surrounding them, silencing any further argument as all eyes returned to their queen as she continued her brief yet prolonged agony before screaming one last time fearfully into understanding before fading away.
Maester Kyrie argued vehemently with the Queen that removing the child from her womb would save her life and possibly even the baby's. But Alyssa was inconsolable and wept, refusing to allow them to perform such a harrowing act. As Septa Maryam took Alysanne away for some comfort, she asked Lord Velaryon of her Kingsguard if they should go against the wishes of their Queen, to which he replied: "Yes, my Lady. We must take steps to relieve Her Grace of this burden so that we may both save her from death and kill what is certain to be a dying babe". With solemn finality Ser Myles Smallwood echoed his fellow knight’s words in agreement as Prudence Celtigar too nodded in accord but added a concrete note: "They must cut it out now or risk losing our Queen- no one is allowed a longer agony than necessary".
Queen Alysanne wept silently in the Birthing Chamber and King Jaehaerys ran to her side. Lord Rogar reminded him of Maester Kyrie's instruction to remove the child from her womb, but Jaehaerys disagreed vehemently, feeling he must save the child, no matter what cost. However, his reluctance was quickly balanced out as he pulled and dragged himself away from her bedside due to heavy pounding on their chamber door by an unknown assailant that kept yelling "you will never save them!". Hearing these repeated threats caused disbelief in Queen Alysanne who shouted angrily at Jaehaerys to protect their unborn son, a plea which went unanswered as Jaehaerys reluctantly made his way towards the ever pounding door behind him.
Lord Rogar bellowed a desperate plea to the King and Maester Kyrie, “Save my son!” His cries echoed off the cold stone walls of the Birthing Chamber. The king shook his head in disbelief, while Kyrie took Lord Rogar roughly by the arm and said they must bear all haste to find help. As Lord Rogar wrenched free of Kyrie' grip and got ready to flee, another knight from Kingsguard dashed in with news of an attack on Dragonstone by Starkshire's army led by Benifer. Queen Alysanne wept as she bade them remember that everyone is here for one common cause - to save her nephew and ward -King Jaehaerys- from peril. With heavy hearts, both men fled and sent word throughout Seven Kingdoms for aid from Daenerys Targaryen and her three dragons – Vhagar, Dreamfyre, Silverwing.
Queen Alyssa woke with a start as she heard the midwife’s cry that signalled the opening of her belly. Tears immediately streamed down her face, both in grief and joy. She cried out for Maester Kyrie to be called and in his presence assented to the saving of her infant daughter, Alysanne. Her Kingsguard quickly took up arms to accompany the Maester on his journey to find Lord Rogar, Rhaena’s brother who had fled with Alysanne during a violent attack. Prudence Celtigar had offered one of her ships from Gulltown so that they may make haste across the Narrow Sea and return quickly to Dragonstone with Alysanne before any more harm could reach her. The queen's last order was for all throughout Westeros -- from Oldtown in the South to Bear Island in the North --to join in a search for her beloved daughter so that she would be safe once more beneath the Great Hall of Dragonstone, sheltered from harm by many loyal knights like Ser Garon Swann and Ser Myles Smallwood who rode at a breakneck pace into an uncertain future carrying only hope within their hearts
Lord Rogar had been desperate for a son, so when Queen Alyssa opened her belly and he heard they'd birthed only the second son of twins, a quiet sadness had filled him. But this soon gave way to joyous amazement upon realizing that the child was actually a girl born so small and weak that midwife and maester alike did not believe she would survive. He quickly got down on his knees and prayed to the gods for her survival before naming her Jocelyn in thanks for being granted such a small but powerful blessing. In years to come, many would come to know of Lord Rogar's love for Jocelyn - from prisoners across the lands coming into King's Landing writining madly of his daughter's beauty as they were wracked by violent pleasure during their stay at Maegor Towers, to star-crossed lovers whispering in awe as he watched Uncle Donnel name Alysanne Targaryen his own ward despite objections put forth by many. Though Lord Rogar was considered one of most powerful men in Westeros, it was perhaps his smallest gift for which he was most remembered: his love for tiny Jocelyn who still held his heart long after she left this world.
Queen Alyssa arrived at Storm's End with her dragon, Vermithor, hotly contended and eagerly awaited. The arrival of the heir to the Iron Throne descended upon the castle like a sweet scented wind on a summer night arousing sentiments of joy but also contentions on who would be raised in the shadow of kingship should Rhaena Targaryen prove too small and weak, much like his second son when Jocelyn first had tales there was a girl so small she barely survived past infancy. Most around her prayed that it would not be so and gave thanks when they named a healthy baby "Rhaena" but all knew that if Queen Alyssa did not soon contend for whom she wanted to raise, Lord Rogar might raise Rhaena with his silver-tongue swordsmanship and pale blue family banner behind him.
Queen Alyssa, Rhaena and her brother had just descended upon Storm's End when they came to find the Queen gone. The maester insisted that they should hurry onward but Rhaena refused the suggestion. Despite their contentious situation in which the king's silver-pale blue gaze was held by all, Rhaena asked of every possible place that she might be coming too late or if anyone had seen her insists on going anyway as did her brother and midwife. Finally they found one man named Rogar who shook his head and said longingly "Perhaps we were too late." Exasperated, the group moved on until no stone was left unturned in their search for Queen Alissa.
She found herself in the Great Hall, pushed through a crowd of knights and courtiers, curse words on her lips she could barely restrain. Her rage at Him that had left her sister to suffer alone filled her with such anger, the air around them felt like it crackled with energy. Boremund was there too, insistent Rhaena Targaryen not be blamed if something happened to Queen Alyssa while they were all away. They both held a gaze on each other - refusing to break before one asked. After what felt like a long eternity without anyone speaking, he stepped aside and let Rhaena pass.
Rogar Baratheon's voice echoed through the Great Hall as he became increasingly outraged. He accused those present of treachery and cursed them in a tone that betrayed his fury. Boremund, Rhaena Targaryen’s brother, leapt to his feet and shouted an answer at Rogar while Knighst put their hands on the hilts of their swords ready to act if need be. As the tension mounted, Lord Velaryon remembered stories of the star-crossed lovers Alys Westhill and Wat the Hewer back in Dragonstone who had recently married despite everyone seeking to keep them apart, giving him hope for a peaceful resolution.
Rhaena watched in shock as her Lord, Rogar Baratheon, rode away from Harrenhal towards Storm's End. He had been outraged by the accusations made against him and was determined to save his name. Rhaena longed for what they could have had together and wished he would turn around and wed her already. Despite his departure she knew he wanted her to want for nothing and that he would always take care of her; no matter the circumstances. However, she remained poor without him, yet still eager to hear about all of their adventures together— a true star-crossed couple indeed.
Lord Rogar stormed from the hall and in the yard, he drank a cup of wine. He terrified everyone around him with his mad anger as he summoned his steward and invoked upon him to invite King Maegor the Cruel and Queen Visenya to Harrenhal. Ser Garon had all intentions to save Rhaena whom his lord intended to wed, so she would want for nothing and they could make her hear dreams that no poor soul should suffer.
Jaehaerys and his mother, Queen Alyssa, had just returned from Oldtown after a long and wearisome voyage. As they reached King's Landing, the relieved people of the land were soon filled with joy at given the recent political unrest plaguing the realm. The mood lightened even more when it was given that Storm's End would be open for Jaerhaerys to visit. Soon after their arrival, Jaehaerys called for a grand feast in which he invited all lords and ladies of Westeros to gather at the capital city and honor him as true ruler of Seven Kingdoms. As they all reached there, Jaehaerys plunged himself into this newfound power iffering him realizing how devoted his people were to their cause but also feeling much sadder with each passing day by knowing how powerful his enemies could become in no time without any warning sign or prophecy. It seemed as if nothing would ever drive away this fear planted deep within his heart but nevertheless Jaehaerys desired to make good use of whatever he had been given so far.
Jaehaerys had returned to King's Landing with his mother, but he was far from the powerful figure he had desired to become. His dreams of grandeur had plunged him into a sadder state as he sought solace in the devotion of The Vulture King and his Three Sisters on the other side of Seven Kingdoms beside the Red Mountains, across from the Stepstones. As autumn crept in and began to blanket Kings Landing with its falling leaves, Jaehaerys felt exhausted dealing with it all alone, sweating until Benifer - one of the Kingsguard - joined him by surprise.
Queen Alysanne had found solace in the company of her daughter, Princess Daenerys. From when she was crawling to lurching and walking and running, Daenerys had been talking since well before her first nameday, telling every story she’d heard or read with great enthusiasm – and asking endless questions that never seemed to have a different answer. It was obvious that young Daenerys was a happy child; endlessly curious, utterly fearless and a delight to all who knew her - even the Vulture King from the Seven Kingdoms along the Red Mountains felt enchanted by Alysanne’s so clever little girl going to be a great queen one day. She took pleasure in reading stories with her daughter each night or preferring to spend long days playing rather than facing what could come alone; yet still everyone at Dragonstone knew Her Grace would continue on as best they could, dealing with it ever since autumn arrived full of falling leaves- each continuing toward their fate whether joyous or sorrowful alike.
The Stranger had heard stories about the wilful wild child of House Targaryen before arriving at Dragonstone. Little Aerea, daughter of Rhaena Targaryen and Princess Dany's cousin defied those around her, abused those below her rank and absented herself from prayers, lessons and meals without leave. He could hardly believe his eyes when he saw the same smirk on Alysanne’s face as she spun tales before His Grace King Jaehaerys just one week after finding new griefs awaiting her in Blackwater Bay . When asked to retreat, it was Daenerys who stepped forward with a different answer; finally standing up for an impish girl who seemed more eager to spend days playing than royal duties - much like the queen remembered crawling, lurching walking then running right next to a young Queen Alysanne told tales and read stories all day long for months at Storm's End before her own mother's passing was lamented  - taught by their happy child, who happily shouldered any task she had been set with utter fearlessness proving a delight to all who knew her. The Stranger smiled as he watched Her Grace’s enchanted magical powers captivate even wild spiritedAlys , so clever that most believed she was truly going to be a great queen someday soon.
Androw Farman, the only son of Lady Elissa Farman and a distant cousin to Queen Alyssa, had been enlisted in House Targaryen's court during Queen Alyssa's failing health. Rhaena immediately resent Androw for his presence and refused to accompany him out on various tasks. After several failed attempts of trying to gain her trust, he ran away from Dragonstone and became a vocal support for the exiled Houses who had openly defied Queen Alyssa. His passionate speeches inspired some who felt as though their anger was appropriately expressed; however Rhaena remained unconvinced and her Grace would not allow one as openly defiant as Androw near Storm’s End which prompted an uncharacteristically angry reaction from the Wilful Wild Child.
Androw Farman and Rhaena had married on the small island of Fair Isle, located off Dragonstone. Both were forgotten, ignored and not spoken of any longer by Queen Alyssa or Her Grace. They sat at opposite ends of their table when they ate together, shared no words at all when in their bed chambers at night and nobody knew that they ever slept in the same room. Being unattached did not suit Androw either as he was comely, puffy-faced and round-shouldered with a certain fleshy lordliness about him that made his appearance better than most others. His beautiful wife however, Rhaena was far prettier than her husband and many whispered behind closed curtains that she could have easily chosen someone better then Androw – if only she had been allowed to do so.
Androw sailed away from Fair Isle, content with his new life as husband to Rhaena. He soon found himself on an island far from Dragonstone and the castle library where he had taken such interest in reading during his time there. Together with Maester Culiper, he swam, fished and trained for battle - all empty activities that filled the hours until King Jaehaerys decided it was time for Androw to make something of himself. The bookish young man had grown strong and passably comely in those months by the sea, a remarkable change from when he'd first arrived - puffy-faced round-shouldered, and fleshy. He knew that life would only get better now that Lordly duties were calling out to him.
The bustling and somewhat chaotic atmosphere in the Chamber of the Painted Table was only amplified by Princess Aerea’s antics, who spent most of her time mocking Maester Culiper or staring him down with a devilish grin. Queen Rhaena barely suppressed her titter as she gazed upon her daughter's mischievousness, paying it no mind as she made plans for visiting Dragonstone on their voyage out at sea. After departing from the Citadel, Androw steered them towards an island off the coast - which provided some refreshment to its passengers. But unbeknownst to them, lurking amongst its rocky paths were two star-crossed lovers -- Vhagar and Her Grace -- whose souls had been bound together but separated by fate - just as dragon and man can never conjoin again.
As Queen Rhaena and the others proceeded out of the Chamber of the Painted Table, her closest friend, Lady Elissa Farman, asked to accompany them on their journey south. They all burst into laughter at her request. It was a welcome change from the cruelest mockery Maester Culiper had received earlier for emptying a chamberpot upon his head. Androw Farman observed and accepted her plea with surprising assurance, given that he was nothing more than a common thief of dragon eggs when they met in Dragonstone. The Queen dismisses Ser Merrell Bullock's offer only to ask Androw; His Grace joked at this suggestion but ultimately allowed him to accompany them to King's Landing - an act no one expected would calm the situation which only grew worse as plans were made for departure. The Princess Aerea took comfort in Androwe’s embrace with tearful denials while everyone else tittered at Her Graces command.
Queen Rhaena was in a state of denial when she returned with Androw Farman to Storm's End. She sat silently, her face drawn into a sullen and cold expression, while Samantha Stokeworth and Alayne Royce discussed the recent troubling events. All around them Lianna Velaryon and Lord Staunton exchanged old stories that seemed too distant from their newer worries; even Cassella was too busy processing what had just happened to say anything more than a few pretty words of comfort. Sitting beside them all was Septa Maryam who only grew worse as Queen Rhaena kept silent despite her denials to the contrary. Through it all, Androw helplessly observed, knowing that no matter how gracious Lady Elissa’s offer had been - his closest friend, mayhaps only friend - all he could do now is accept her departure tearful denials and scornfully laughed at requests for him to accompany her to King's Landing.
Queen Rhaena had come to Dragonstone feeling sullen, having been denied a return to Storm's End. She had come to find an answer; however, the cold and stormy landscape of Westeros seemed gloomy and her energy waned as she came closer to her destination. The short-lived peace that had seemed so inviting when she left north of the Narrow Sea also dampened her spirits. Amidst all this trouble, a new desire arose in her heart: someplace far away from Westeros -- somewhere she could settle down, perhaps start anew where nobody knew her name or understood the old troubles that sat heavy on her shoulders?
Maester Culiper, after much deliberation and study of the Sweating Sickness and the Shaking sickness that had been wreaked havoc on Westeros from North to South and beyond the Narrow Sea, pronounced his determination that a terrible sort of bloody magic was at play and upon seeing Maester Anselm's affirmation, The Queen strongly agreed. Despite diverging opinions amongst some Lords in Dragonstone as to who or what could be blamed for these terrible afflictions, it seemed all suspected there was strong supernatural forces at hand – a suspicion that unfortunately only grew stronger with the passing days.
Cassella Staunton, Septa Maryam and Alayne Royce had been boastful of how they were able to read the signs of the two sicknesses that had caused Maester Culiper to pronounce terrible diagnoses. The Queen was determined not to blame them for this terror and instead assumed it must be a more powerful force at work. But when Cassella Staunton, Septa Maryam and her four-and-ten others succumbed to a new, more bloody variety of shaking sickness after Sam Stokeworth yelled out "boisterous frivolities," strong in his belief that he'd been impervious its grasp - they all knew then just how wrong they had been.
When Rhaena Targaryen arrived at Dragonstone, she was saved by Maester Anselm and Culiper. Lord Rego Draz commended her courage and said that Rhaena had “felled beasts bigger than any boast made in the four-and-ten of King’s Landing”. Though Alayne Royce and Cassella Staunton had succumbed to the same sickness that befell Septa Maryam, Rhaena had prevailed due to her own strength and will. She set about to bring Dragonstone back to its former glory but no matter how much she changed it, one thing remained unchanged - her love for Sam Stokeworth, whom she still held dear despite his illness. However, despite his weak physical state, he seemed inexplicably healthy in a way only divine intervention could explain.
Queen Rhaena commanded Lord Velaryon to send forth his galleys so that no one could escape Dragonstone and spread the disease beyond the island. The order was meant to act in the best of interests for all, but it did not make the bereaved smallfolk at Dragonstone any less grief-stricken. Even Lady Alayne Royce, Rhaena's dear friend and Queen Alyssa's younger sister, was shaken by the news that their beloved island had been afflicted by this pestilence. Nevertheless, her hope in Queen Rhaena remained unchanged -- together they would prevail against this hardship as they had done before.
Rhaena Targaryen wept bitterly as Lianna Velaryon, her beloved younger sister, died in Maester Anselm's arms at their ancestral home of Driftmark. She had seen death more times that she cared to remember - from distant relatives to the smallfolk who had suffered during the pestilence - but nothing compared to the grief of losing a family member so close to her. To purge her sorrows and stop them from overtaking her completely, Rhaena commanded her Kingsguard and Lady Alayne Royce over an arduous journey across Westeros with Lord Myles Smallwood then south over seas to Pentos; a place they knew they'd find solace and possibly answers. From King's Landing all the way up past Red Mountains onto Maidenpool and back again; Rhaena acted wth a mix of grief and desperation never seen nor heard before by those travelling with her.  When they finally returned back to Dragonstone, affected by what she had looked upon on this quest for clarity, peace or justice seemed almost imminent given how far everyone had come in covering this entire journey.
Androw Farman was a devoted friend of Rhaena Targaryen and no one in Driftmark saw him weep for her more than anyone else did. Despite the bitter tears that were shed that day, he managed to remain strong when commanded by Lady Elissa Farman to leave. He wanted so much more time before she passed on but shall be forever grateful for the time they had shared together on his last visit at Dragonstone. As he silently wept, the King's Guards lashing him across the face - with all of Ser Myles Smallwood, Lord Velaryon, Lady Prudence Celtigar and Septa Ysabel's knowledge - awakened something inside of him as if Queen Alyssa heard his plea from beyond life itself.
Queen Rhaena and her court of Lord Velaryon, Rego Draz and Jaehaerys assembled at Dragonstone to discuss the deaths on the island. Maester Anselm gave voice to suspicion that rose in the assembly hall with furrowed brows, "My lord," he said, his face a shock of fear, "it may be that these deaths were not just an unfortunate accident but something more dishonorable." Before they could draw further conclusions, a Stranger entered the room cloaked in Scarlet - none other than Cassella Staunton from Oldtown. She relayed news of an attack on Smallwood’s stronghold by forces under Lyman Lannister's command and Alys Westhill's army marching towards Riverrun. Queen Rhaena commanded her Kingsguard to leave for The Vale while she contemplated their next move over a dish served by Septa Edyth. It seemed all too clear now that war was coming - whether it be from King Mooton across the Sunset Sea or Alaric Stark bringing unrest from The North, only time would tell who was to blame for this horror unfolding.
Septon Barth and Grand Maester Benifer concurred when Lord Rego recommended sending a raven to Dragonstone. They were standing in the great hall of Dragonstone, trying to give voice to suspicion that had been growing since Maester Anselm had discussed the sudden deaths on the island. After Queen Rhaena Targaryen read it, she commanded her captain of her guards be brought before her. The lords of the council found him in short order, and summoned him forthwith. It was then they realized they needed someone with more cunning if they were expected to solve this strange mystery- Lady Alayne Royce was dispatched on a secret mission across the sea to seek aid from those familiar with seedy underbellies of Free Cities such as Pentos or Tyrosh. All common folk lost in shock could only furrow their brows as an air of dishonorable conduct hung thickest in these walls.
Rhaena Targaryen was marching through the corridors of Dragonstone with her captain of her guards in tow when they came across Androw Farman, one of the castle’s maesters. The concurred that something had gone wrong and Farman brought them to Maester Anselm’s bedchamber, where they found he had been discovered dead. Rhaena commanded that word be sent immediately to the great hall, summoning all her lords and allies from across Dragonstone, including Septon Barth and Grand Maester Benifer who she knew would be able to help uncover what happened.
Androw Farman was welcomed into the Chamber of the Painted Table with great fanfare, and though he had come to talk of treasonous poisonings in the court, his gaze lingered on all that surrounded him. He clutched a letter in one hand as an attempt to deny any involvement, while he boasted of being brought to Justice by Ser Myles Smallwood and Lady Prudence Celtigar. Little did they know Androw drank deeply from their cup of wisdom before thanking them for it and then falling off into a long sword fight which could have done more damage than he ever killed on his own. He desperately hoped that this gift would be enough for those who had given it or else he knew things could have gone very differently. With newfound conviction coursing through his veins, Androw marched towards the Sept knowing full well what might await him up ahead in Aegon's Garden where Queen Alyssa suggested so many moons ago...
Rhaena Targaryen deigned to speak from her high seat in the Chamber of the Painted Table, making a proclamation that sent shivers down Androw Farman's spine. She commanded two of the Kingsguard to take him and geld him for his attempt to deny his guilt in the series of poisonings that had taken place at Dragonstone. He had boasted he was innocent, yet he had brought aloud pitchers of sweet jape into court, drank them himself and thanked those who gave them - unaware they were poisoned.  With these words Rhaena made it clear she could have done much worse than what she did; yet she offered mercy if Lord Velaryon would staunch his wound before he fell off and be fed until every last crumb was eaten, lest he be killed as soon as he is given a longsword.
Rhaena Targaryen, standing and rallying in front of the Painted Table said to Androw Farman, "Grasp this situation. We cannot her defeat him here so take him, geld him and staunch his wound." Everyone at the table was still as Rhaena spoke. As soon as she finished speaking, Androw leapt out from his chair and flew away with their prisoner on control - determined that he would not die until he had eaten every last bit of remorse fed to him. Rhaena watched but could only do ineffectually as her brother Rogar targeted a landing spot far below where he intend to have his body hacked to pieces before feeding them to Dragonstone's dragons Lady Elissa Farman or Dreamfyre or Vhagar; all seemed apt satisfiers for a Queen's rage.
The Year of the Stranger dawned amidst stories of feasting and celebration. As far away as the Seven Kingdoms, its festivities were notable if only for their terrible twist; in one kingdom Androw Farman had to spread word that his beloved Rhaena Targaryen had fled downward from the Painted Table, her body ultimately hacked to pieces and fed to her dragons. He moved around with a haunted, broken spirit thereafter until this day when many all over mourned the star-crossed lovers.
When King Androw Farman stepped down as Hand of the King during the Year of the Stranger, great feasting and celebration spread through Dragonstone much to Lord Daemon Velaryon's appreciation. In a private council with Queen Alyssa and his daughter Lianna, he announced a proposal - "we should move our own small council from Dragonstone to Driftmark due to my advancing age." The other lords in attendance felt uneasy about such suggestion but accepted it nonetheless. It was then that Lord Manfryd Redwyne spoke up, suggesting they ought to send ships out towards Pentos instead while they still can. At this point, Queen Alyssa poisioned by her thirst for power accepteraised his plan with no hesitation; she thought aloud that if they could find allies over there perhaps they could even rule all of Westeros one day.
Jaehaerys rose from the Iron Throne and looked out at the Council. His gaze earned a few intimidated glances, but Lord Albin Massey remained unfazed. In a calm voice, he suggested they would strike down anyone who dared to oppose them, emphasizing that their power was great and those opposing them must be punished in a very low way. That sinister statement caught every councilmember off guard until King Jaehaerys announced it was time to break for long overdue rest.<br>  The mood of the room drastically changed when Septon Barth walked in revealing an even greater force had just arrived. All of the characters on global context now found themselves aware of this menacing new figure as Jaehaerys allowed little conversation yet all seemed to understand that much more than simly rest awaited them beyond these walls.
Rogar Baratheon, King Maegor and Lord Tully had a regency to bring back the Iron Throne. The council was undistinguished and of very low authority, but allowed Jaehaerys to earn respect from other great houses. Rogar pursued into The Vale in order to try and stop an untimely assassination of Lord Darnold from wildling raiders who had descended from the mountains. Prudence Celtigar then asked Ser Rymond, Donnel Hightower, Lyman Lannister and Bertrand Tyrell for their aid against these attackers. Alaric Stark was one of the few survivors of this hostile attack as he fled with his loyal servants through Winterfell and Eyrie before eventually reaching Highgarden.
Jaehaerys had ridden with Ser Myles Smallwood and Aegon at the vanguard of Lord Stokeworth's bannermen. They fought in the Battle of Acorn Hall, then rode swift to Stonebridge where Wat the Hewer slew Harren the Red. However King Aenys was too late - his bannermen had already turned to an older man who fulfilled their qualifications as a suitable king. As they bandied stories around great campfires beneath starry skies, Jaehaerys listened closely  to tales of experience: Aegon's blooded martiality on Vhagar, Rhaena Targaryen’s brother fighting wildling raiders deep north beyond The Wall, Lord Darnold slain by dragon fire...
Ser Myles Smallwood had just persuaded Lord Stokeworth to allow his bannerman Ser Willam to join the savage fights of Acorn Hall. Young Lord Jaerhaerys was fiercely against it, knowing too well that even warriors with greater experience than Willam would fall in these battles. But, Lord Myles managed to persuade them all regarding Willams' loyalty and martial proficiency. Soon, Jaehaerys accompanied them as well and they rode out their horses together. As they reached their destination, Jaehaerys saw a mix of fierce seasoned fighters alongside brave but inexperienced youth wearing Mail shirts and helms - They were lady Lucinda's leal knights - Justly famed for being some of the finer and fiercer warriors in the realm.
Queen Alysanne flew into King's Landing on the back of Balerion and immediately set out to Dragonstone, comforted by the thought that perhaps with her selection of the King's Hand they could begin deliberating more justly. Just as her father Jaehaerys had been famed for his finer persuasion than fiercer fights, she was determined to wear leal counsel rather than engaging in savage battles. Lord Myles and Ser Willam rode with her in honor guard, whilst Prentys Tully and Lady Lucinda remained at Acorn Hall assenting to the Queen’s plan. As they arrived upon Dragonstone, all seemed quiet save for those star-crossed lovers Wat and Alys Westhill who exchanged their whispers within the shadows of Maegor Towers
Rhaena Targaryen comforted Her Grace as they plunged their grief together in the castle, her mind races with welcomings and send aways. Suddenly she screamed out in rage, barred the doors of the chamber and ate dear Alysanne's treasured heirloom raven-shaped hairpin as if it were an offering. The black mood that enveloped Rhaena was like a far distant shore, and yet too close for comfort at the same time.
Alysanne Targaryen, determined to restore a modicum of order to Dragonstone, quickly set out setting a new maester, appointing a new captain and sending for Septa Edyth. Before she arrived though her beloved Maegor Towers were plunged into chaos by the arrival of her distant cousin from Vulture King's court, the Stranger. This enraged Rhaena Targaryen and she screamed for him to be sent away before she barred the castle doors. But after comforted by her grace Alys Westhill, Rhaena slowly accepted Alysanne as queen. With Septa Edth comes hope as everyone thought that She can assume control of Dragonstone and bring peace to it once again.
Alysanne accompanied Princess Aerea and Rhaena on a journey to Fair Isle while Lady Elissa followed soon after. The journey had been filled with events Alysanne could scarcely have anticipated; she had encountered ridicule, shunned stares and shared tears like never before. With a heavy heart, she finally put the princess in the lap of Lady Elissa as they cuddled together, yet still found it difficult to give her away. As soon as Vulture King flew off into the west, Alysanne felt a wave of emotions provoked within her — she broke down in tears pleading for one more night or one last look at Aerea - until suddenly, she forgot all about them as His Grace requested her attendance at King’s Landing urgently.
Queen Alysanne moved by the girl’s tears, urged King Jaehaerys to do no more than promise her a meal. But he rejected the notion out of hand, as shouts from both Rhaena and Princess Aerea soon filled the Stone Drum. Realizing this would not be settled anytime soon, His Grace summoned Princess Aerea to his quarters in an attempt to reconcile mother and daughter. However, shouting at one another quickly rang through the Stone Drum, prompting him to rebuke them both. In defeat her Grace finally returned to kings Landing while fleeing ravens flew upwards spreading news of the confrontations at Stone Drum across Westeros. Sitting atop Dragonstone's walls with Lady Elissa Farman was Benifer – Hand of the King – who took it upon himself together with Septa Maryam and Kingsguard to intervene under orders from His Grace yet it seemed none could stop mother and daughter's passionate cries - reverberating merry melodies that even Vhagar heard during its flight over Dragonstone towards Gullet where Prince Aegon and his star-crossed lovers were waiting for their queen's return
When Lord Redwyne arrived in King's Landing, it was a time of great celebration. The Year of the Stranger had come to an end, and all shared in the joy that came with it, most particularly those lords and ladies who attended the King at his return to the Dragonpit. As the cavernous new structure slowly began to dominate the landscape around Aegon's High Hill and Rhaenys's Hill, Jaehaerys proposed a grand ceremony to celebrate its completion. But before long arguing erupted amongst various lords on how best to stage such an event - some, led by Lord Redwyne himself, argued for something lavish and sumptuous while others wanted nothing more than a quick meal and then return to their respective homes. In spite of this opposition King Jaehaerys' vision ultimately prevailed but not without forgetting those who were left behind - like Queen Alysanne who had moved only recently back from Dragonstone -as they would remain in King's Landing while their superiors went out into more merry pastures.
Rhaena Targaryen and Septon Barth stood atop the towers of Dragonstone, looking down on what they had created. The sudden and unexpected roar that echo throughout Gods Eye was one that caused fear in even the bravest people. It was Vermithor and Silverwing, two massive dragon risen up as a symbol of Rhaena's power. They tore apart the sky above them with their roars, signifying the completion of Dragonstone as Rhaena had proposed to celebrate at the end of Year of the Stranger. All those present in King’s Landing sought to dominate and forget Jaehaerys I Targaryen’s great dream for it seemed far too ambitious for most to allow its reality. Still, there was something special about standing on Aegon's High Hill, watching Vermithor and Silverwing rise up from beneath the mammothly cavernous remains of what used to be Maegor Towers - memories flooded back into Rhaena's mind about her brother Rogar and his star-crossed lovers Alys Westhill and Lady Elissa Farman; all gone now like Aegon the Conqueror himself but never forgotten by those who loved them.
Rhaena and Dreamfyre, along with Maegor and Aerea, fled from the yards of Dragonstone as the hissing and snapping of fight reached their ears. The sudden unexpectedness created a fearful atmosphere, in which they all rose up to tear apart the looming darkness and storm out shouting. Prudence Celtigar joined them in stealing through the shadows claiming her kingdom while Septon Barth supported His Grace's action by echoing constantly in their ears.
Rhaena and Maegor had to take Balerion, the Black Dread, for the fight against their foes. Exclaimed Maegor, “He was the only one who could have slain them all! We must have him!” Rhaena then suggested that they visit Dragonstone in order to give birth to this mad child because it was rumoured many years ago that someone will be able to call forth a beast like Balerion.  Accompanied by Dreamfyre, Aerea and her brother Rogar, they flew back towards Dragonstone with Lord Manfryd Redwyne on Vulture King in tow. Lady Elissa Farman and other dragons from far away were waiting for them at Dragonstone yards. For most of them it was an unbelievable sight as never before have so many powerful dragons been seen together in one place.
Queen Alysanne had been closely following Rhaena's progression and despaired as the queen had to have the Black Dread. Although she wanted her to be safe, she could not express it for fear of offending a Targaryen. When Maegor slew Balerion, Queen Alysanne was filled with dread and exclaimed in little angry voice that these mad children - were no longer ordinary ones. Seeing the situation getting worse by each passing day, Queen Alysanne along with Septon Barth and Grand Maester Benifer fled from King's Landing to Dragonstone seeking support from the lords of the council, only to find out they didn't stand any chance against such a mad king as Maegor was. Meanwhile little Aerea who was only a few months old at that time give birth to another dragon called Silverwing on an island near Westeros- A catastrophe which made it clear that Rhaena wasn't doing any better and fully lost in madness like her brother.
King Jaehaerys and Grand Maester Benifer had learned that if they wanted to hide Rhaena, Aerea and Queen Alysanne they would have to send them away from Westeros. He decided on a big and fearsome plan; he sent them secretly by a merchant captain of Braavos across the Narrow Sea. He calmly hoped that the Star-crossed Lovers, who had fled King's Landing in little anger faced with Mad King Aerys wouldn't be found. With the help of Lord Velaryon and Ser Myles Smallwood, Prudence Celtigar of Sunseasept Septa Ysabel were also sent along for protection as well as Lord Manfryd Redwyne who acted as his brother Rogar Baratheon would act if Rhaenys was his own sister or Lady Elissa Farman should it turn out that Aegon The Conqueror deemed him fit for such an important task.
Princess Aerea, Rhaena and Princess Daenerys flew to the Red Keep at Westeros on their dragons. Weaving in between lofty towers, they remained idle and unfrightened as their dragons soared high in the sky. As soon as they landed near the castle entrance, little Aerea declared that she was determined to find her brother here who had disappeared from their kingdom a few months ago. Grand Maester Benifer comforted her with wise words and noble King Jaehaerys reminded them about courage and valor even when surrounded by cruel people and fearsome creatures. They all mounted up again, looking for more clues of what might have happened.
Lord Rogar Baratheon wed Princess Daenerys, the daughter of Rhaena Targaryen, in a secret ceremony that was held at Dragonstone. Despite being far away from Red Keep and King's Landing, many lords such as Lord Velaryon and Lady Alayne Royce still managed to attend the wedding. Incidentally, it was Queen Alyssa Targaryen’s niece Lianna Velaryon who served as one of two witnesses for the marriage. She had been like a star-crossed lover to both Rogar and Rhaena’s brother since their parents wanted them separated due to an ancient feud between their families. As they watched Lord Rogar wed Princess Daenerys, they all remained silent with idle fright even though little did they know that this union would soon transform Westeros into a cruel kingdom ruled by Maegor the Cruel.
