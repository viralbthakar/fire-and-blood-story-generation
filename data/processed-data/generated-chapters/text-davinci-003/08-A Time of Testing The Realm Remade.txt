King Jaehaerys I Targaryen and Queen Alysanne returned to King's Landing after arriving from Dragonstone earlier in the week. Accompanied by their entourage, they were greeted with celebration as the townspeople rejoiced at the return of their beloved monarchy. Although triumphant, the atmosphere was still fraught with uncertainty- many questions remained unanswered such as why Queen Alyssa had chosen to remain alone on Dragonstone while her husband and wife returned together. Nevertheless, House Targaryen received loyal support from its allies including Lord Vermithor, Lady Albin Massey of Leffords at the Golden Tooth and Princess Aerea Targaryen- all standing with them in a show of allegiance against would-be kings who sought to challenge them for control over Westeros.
Grand Maester Benifer and the other denizens of King's Landing all held their breath, pausing on that day when they heard the bells toll and caught sight of the dragon astride his mount Vermithor in the distant skies. As they grew closer to the inner yard of Red Keep’s walls atop Aegon’s High Hill, an air of auspiciousness cloaked them in its grey wings as a persistent whisper grazed their ears; King Jaehaerys I Targaryen had returned. Knights, squires, stableboys and washerwomen alike all waited eagerly awaiting the king's coming with flutters of hope closely abreast within their hearts.
King Jaehaerys I Targaryen and his great dragon, Vermithor, swept over King's Landing from Maegor's Holdfast with a wave of eager shouts that marveled the citizens below. The people of House Targaryen brought an auspicious heralding  for the king's arrival - Red Keep’s walls grew alive with held collective breaths as caught sight of silverwings in the sky. Grand Maester Benifer himself had arrived at the inner yard of the Red Keep awaiting the king's landing and could not contain his joy when he heard and saw what was unfolding before him.
It was the Dragon that changed everything. Reports of a giant black and red dragon flying around Westeros had thrilled everyone in King's Landing, filled out with stories of a noble stripling who could enchantedly ride it. When Benifer arrived to Dragonstone along with his student they conquered every eye in Pentos; she bore herself like no one before on a dragon, wearing fine studded armour and commanding Silverwing as if it were her own beast. Rose in terror at first, the people soon settled down and only whispered of an ancient power long gone… Jaehaerys I Targaryen had returned!  Flew around beyongd the sea for several days to reconvene with House Targaryen; Viserys spoke about how Rhaena might be part of his plan in ruling then Seven Kingdoms, using her own bloodline from Aerea Targaryen - The Goodwife- to sweep against would-be kings through Maegor's Holdfast. As Alysanne admired from their landing on King's Landing, Vermithor spread it’s wings and brougtht out a wave of shout followed by marvel - the Iron Throne had new claimants after all!
The bells began to ring in celebration. The loud sound rang through the city, and even King Jaehaerys looked up from his throne with a dispelled smile on his face. In front of him stood the Grand Maester Benifer, Lord Tully and several other lords who had bowed their heads in respect of the king's arrival on Vermithor's back. Lord Tully pulled off his fine studded velvet cloak that he had wore for the occasion as they watched His Grace slid gracefully from Vermithor's back with a mischievous glint in his eye as he said "Well I certainly have work to do". With that, 9-year-old Jaehaerys Targaryen rose from where he had settled and nodded slightly towards the crowd before flying into action assembling all of House Targaryes' allies at Dragonstone, The Arbor, Lys, Pentos and many more cities around Westeros for an uprising against the would-be kings - some of whom has already fled to Iron Bank of Braavos or Tyrosh seeking refuge after hearing news about silverwing being set free by I - young Maegor.
King Jaehaerys, the young king and his regent no more, stepped out from secluded Maegor's Holdfast with Queen Alyssa at his side. Grand Maester Benifer was following closely behind them as murmurs of joyless welcome accompanied them every step of their way. As soon as they appeared in the castle yard with faces red and puffy from weeping, Lord Tully, who knelt before him yet again on behalf of the other lords - called bells to be sounded throughout city, announcing a feast fit for Luminary in honor of King Jaehaerys. Visiting nobles had already began pouring into the court from all corners of Seven Kingdoms such as House Targaryen’s Myr riders under Lord Massey who brought news that Albin had dispelled Veyland Hightower’s would-be kings and Leffords at the Golden Tooth who arrived swiftly with Aerea Targaryen still sitting atop Vermithor gracefully pulled off by Ser Joffrey Doggett - smiled edgewise at King I when he said, “we have work to do”.  The rejoicing nobles lit up numerous candles within great hall signaling the start of Welcoming feast for King Jaehaerys I Targaryen .
King Jaehaerys, Queen Alyssa and Grand Maester Benifer had all gathered at Maegor's Holdfast for a welcoming feast but none of them were in a joyous mood. Lord Daemon Velaryon, the luminary of their council and regent no more, had appeared with his face red and puffy from weeping. With numerous emotions running around the place, Jaehaerys announced the remaking of the council while replacing those who needed to be replaced and confirming those who should be retained. He then thanked Lord Corbray for being reunited with him at Dragonstone along with Tully family from Riverrun and Lucinda from The Arbor. He also confirmed Albin Massey's appointment as a maester by giving him a maester’s chain that Manfryd Redwyne had been carrying off since Robert found it on Rickard's body. Furthermore, he named Ryam to thanks for his service although he was suffering from twisted spine whether due to his old age or any other reason was not known yet . Moreover, it would be his first time taking part in such an exclusive gathering, something unthinkable when he was just a young king wandering across Westeros.
Queen Alysanne rejoiced at the news of Jaehaerys' confirmation and praised him for his success in replacing key council members. When Lord Edwell Celtigar was dismissed as master of coin, the king spoke highly of his loyalty and thanked him for his service with a handsome reward. King Jaehaerys departed from Dragonstone on the Targaryen's dragon Vermithor, leaving Queen Alysanne behind to remain at court with her loyal subject Prunella Celtigar, daughter of Edwell. Upon their arrival to Kings' Landing they were greeted by three men- Tom the Strummer, Ronnal and Donnel Hightower- who struck down those that would stand in opposition against the young King. The trio gave thanks for their reunion while carrying off Maester’s chain Jemmy had been carrying off when he left to save Leffords at the Golden Tooth from Aerea Targaryen, newly named King's Justice.
Lord Edwell's dismissal from his post as master of coin was all the realm could talk about. The king had kept those around him on their toes, urging them to reach out and find a suitable man to fill Lord Edwell's place. King Jaehaerys had certain expectations for the richest among Westeros, and looked everywhere for someone who was not only bold enough to take on the challenge in court, but noble and true enough to remain loyal to he and Queen Alysanne. In Oldtown beyond the Narrow Sea, Septon Moon found Lyman Lannister -- a bold banker fit for the task -- which sent many of those at court into rejoicing. They praised His Grace Jaehaerys I Targaryen while they struck down Donnel Hightower and Septon Moon’s “High Lickspittle” with insults. But while they rejoiced at the suitable man appointed master of coin and continued praising House Targaryen, little did they know what fate awaited Westeros if it ever strayed away from their rule...
King Jaehaerys had risen to the task of finding a suitable person to replace Lord Edwell as master of coin and named Rego Draz from Pentos, sometimes referred to as 'The Taxman'. Though they had been almost entirely shunned in Westeros, the king found himself looking towards him for an answer. Donnel Hightower -- along with other nobles of the court -- urged Jaehaerys that this rich man would be most suitable for such a position. He finally appointed Lyman Lannister as Master of Coin but looked favourably on Rego Draz's proposal. With his bold approach to giving Westeros some much-needed respite from its chaotic financial situation, he was dubbed the 'richest lowborn' in all of the Seven Kingdoms by Septon Moon.
The newly crowned realm King Jaehaerys had sent a raven off to Highgarden, fulminating its dismissal of Lord Massey and his cohorts from court. Every look askance from his courtiers confirmed this as well - they were required to remain silent despite their anger that such an act had come from the king, who was only 13 at the time. The fat and furious Septon Mattheus was not so shy in declaring that no matter how rich Lord Massey may have been, those taxes would be exacted. In addition to sending Oswayk and Ysabel back with him, even Lord Massey's own daughter Septon Barth went back with them. Due to these actions, many of Westeros' richest noble houses began to look askance at the young Targaryen King, dubbing him 'Jaehaerys the Answer'.
Mattheus and Septon Barth had sent off their fulminations with the dismissal well-received by both Oswyck and Ysabel, their curious stares 'looking askance' at each other as they remained to see who else was 'coming from', declaring that further action was required in order to quell the fat and furious local lords. Four days later they traveled south, passing Oldtown on their way to Bitterbridge where they crossed the Mander. Mattheus was a corpulent man, his gilded armor shining despite all its ornamentation as every step jingled ever so loudly with each swing of his arm. Septon Barth walked by his side quietly taking in the sights and sounds of this strange new city, comforting Mattheus with occasional remarks about Lord Massey's approach before them.
The young king made his way through the bustling streets of King's Landing to the Red Keep, where he was met with a steady stream of nobles and important courtiers - including Keeper of the Keys, chief steward, understewards, harbormaster, Warden of the King’s Mint and his master-at-arms as well as kennelmaster and master of horse. The castle ratcatchers were even called upon to help make a clean sweep in preparation for his arrival. He commanded that all lesser offices be completely emptied out, but allowed any prisoners in the black cells a chance to make an appeal lest they feared they might well be innocent men imprisoned unjustly. As far away places from Oldtown to Maidenpool heard stories travel about this new unknown king replacing Lord Rogar Baratheon who passed at Bitterbridge some days agowords before crossing Mander on their journey - nobody could quite guess what lay ahead for this kingdom so far left behind in Westeros by past Targaryen kings.
King Jaehaerys had done as much as he could to assemble a council around him. Grand Maester Benifer, Lord Rogar Baratheon of Storm's End and other nobles from across the realm were amongst those summoned. With the help of the chief steward, chamberlains and understewards had been assigned throughout the castle and city, replacing some of the lower offices in an effort to make a clean sweep. The harbormaster was also commended by His Grace for his work in ensuring proper order was kept with regards to laws on ships entering Oldtown and Maidenpool. When it came time for those accused of minor crimes among the less privileged people in Black Cells ravens were dispatched so that all suspected criminals would be allowed their due appeal before sentence be passed. This decision was met with cheers throughout Red Keep including from House Targaryen who feared that innocent men might well be imprisoned if any hasty decisions were made without a fair trail first being permitted. 
As Lord Rogar, Ser Borys and Garon anxiously arrived early to Storm's End in response to the summons of Grand Maester Benifer and Jaehaerys' letter, they were surprised to find Ronnal already there. The arrival of the king's letter had set the men at odds, which proved true when Ronnal said he urged the King not to send them and wanted to explain what he meant. He then took his leave and set off for King's Landing amidst the most volatile and belligerent company present. Conversely, Jaehaerys stayed on as calmest and oldest among them all hoping for a peaceful resolution between House Targaryen forces at the Wall and Leffords at Golden Tooth Castle along his journey via Oldtown.
The king had just received Ser Joffrey Doggett and Ser Lorence Roxton, Lord Rogar and Grand Maester Benifer at the Iron Throne. As they made the long walk from the doors to the throne, a hush descended upon them as The King received them seated on the Iron Throne with his crown upon his head. He stood there in all his royal finery, regal enameled white armor glinting in whatever light reached it from beyond this mighty throne room; an echo of silence hung in air until he humbled himself before him and set about speaking about matters of state. Suddenly another character entered the scene - Aerea Targaryen, a daughter of House Targaryen descending atop Vermithor - one of their three dragons. Now set at odds between old allegiances and loyalties to unexpected allies, none present knew how these events would play out, but most agreed that she was surely among the calmest (perhaps even wisest) of those present - especially compared to some of her more volatile and belligerent peers such Rhaena Targaryen or Jaehaerys I Targarayen. 
Lord Rogar stood humbly in front of King Jaehaerys, the young heir to the Iron Throne, as he asked for his fealty. There was a moment of raised silence before His Grace spoke. "What do you mean to do?" he asked slowly. Lord Rogar smiled and replied that he had meant to swear his allegiance and loyalty to Jaehaerys with all that it entailed. The king nodded and said, "You have planned well". He came forward then, and took in Lord Rogar's spledid silvered enameled armor which shone even brighter than the white walls of Storm's End they were currently in. As he did so, every lord and minor noble present echoed with an oath of their own taking after Jaehaerys famed dragonriders - Vermithor, Silverwing among others- who proudly swore themselves to House Targaryen generations ago during the Conquest era; indeed it seemed as though time itself had taken on a renewed vigour at the thought of what might be achieved now a new generation was set at hand .
Jaehaerys and Princess Aerea were travelling in a wagon from Storm's End to the Iron Throne when Rhaella, daughter of House Targaryen, joined them. As they went on, Jaehaerys spoke enthusiastically about what he wished for his rule. He suggested sending loyal Vermithor troops to remove any would-be kings that threatened the Seven Kingdoms. The princess agreed with Jaehaerys and even promised to send her own knights led by Lord Rogar, if needed. As they arrived at their destination, Jaehaerys spoke solemnly of the great responsibility resting upon him - a responsibility that would determine the fate of not only himself but also all Westerosians living across every corner of the realm.
Jaehaerys and Princess Aerea had just left the Iron Throne, leaving Rhaella to take her place as queen. My father took me aside and spoke to me of what I might deserve if I allied with him. He wished that his dragon would rise against him when his marriage was made known, and suggested that I be sent to the Wall in order to remove any treasonous actions or foolish words uttered by my presence at court. Beyond the grand gates of Red Keep’s walls lies a realm beset on all sides by would-be kings and rebel lords, who will no doubt rise against me when my marriage is made known. But with the help of House Targaryen's loyal Vermithor—and friends like Albin Massey bring from Leffords at the Golden Tooth, Aerea Targetgeryen soon found out she could trust, even King's Justice Jennis Templeton—I could face these forces down should they wish for war. “Fight for me, to die for me…and for my Queen, if need be," he said before we parted ways.
Lord Rogar looked up to King Jaehaerys, "Your Grace," he said sternly. He spoke of the pardons that were being granted, listing all the loyal lords who had suffered in defense of their king. All those present in Storm's End were thunderstruck by the emotion and solemnity in his voice as he returned a show of loyalty for His Grace. Some among them were Reynes at Castamere, Marbrands at Ashemark and Leffords at Golden Tooth; they got on one bent knee repeated Lord Rogar's salute with whatever strength remained after months of looking stood up against so many would-be kings and rebel lords.
Lord Rogar asked Lord Hightower and Ser Orryn to command the sellswords and sail out of Oldtown, a port city in the Reach. The two men complied without hesitation, fully aware of the situation at The Wall in the north. King Jaehaerys had already heard grim news from Qarth and Disputed Lands about smallfolk suffering under rebel lords; he was thunderstruck with emotion upon hearing Lord Rogar's request. Stern-faced, His Grace said nothing before looking up to his faithful advisors; however, he nodded in agreement — a few sellswords would make all difference here at Storm's End.
Lord Rogar responded to the command of King Jaehaerys with a sternness that required no argument. He had just sent Ser Orryn, his most trusted and loyal knight, to Oldtown on a mission of extraordinary importance. It was believed that in the village folk tales there lay vital information about the Disputed Lands beyond Qarth. The Targaryen household, including princess Aerea and dragon Vermithor, proceeded towards Bitterbridge to receive aid from House Massey - one of the loyal vassals who still remained after the reigns of various would-be kings - while Lord Rogar went on alone in search for unknown lands prophecised during Alysanne's visit to Starry Sept.
King Jaehaerys descended the dais with Lord Rogar and Grand Maester Benifer following close behind. He gazed around the Iron Throne and into the inner ward of the Red Keep, his nostrils flaring with rage at what had been done: Every man and maid and child in the stormlands were now held as his hostages. The sentence he bellowed was a thunderous roar that echoed through the castle walls; "Any who oppose me will be slaughtered, their lands burned and their homes raised to ash!"
King Jaehaerys and Queen Alysanne had descended from the Iron Throne, inviting Lord Rogar to Storm’s End for a feast in honor of peace made between them. After feasting and raising many a toast, King Jaehaerys and Ser Pate the Woodcock escorted Lord Rogar out of the great hall back toward his own lands in Kingswood. With Vermithor following faithfully behind their procession, Grand Maester Benifer made sure that all accounts were sealed with an official document to ensure that none could question their arrangement. As they departed Storm’s End, Aerea Targaryen watched proudly from her balcony - finally feeling safe enough now that peace was secured by her father's hand. His Grace had saved his realm once more!
Jaehaerys I Targaryen had loomed large in the political scene of the Seven Kingdoms since assuming the Iron Throne long ago. Though his reign was often considered peaceful, much needed to be done - new alliances formed and old disputes resolved - as the dangers of a mounting unrest had become all too real. As if in secret reflection of this situation, when King Jaehaerys sat on his empty throne at King's Landing, his presence seemed almost ghost-like. But with newfound resolve, he moved forward: summoned lords from every corner of his realm to a great feast hosted by House Lannister at Casterly Rock, made treaties and signed alliances – each step towards achieving peace slowly being laid before him filled times that were proving increasingly more difficult.
Rego Draz, representing the Iron Bank of Braavos and Tyrosh, Myr had shot his bow as far back from Dragonpit up to the Hill of Rhaenys to resolve Jaehaerys I Targaryen's mounting debts into a deal that was substantial but still favorable for all sides. The banks had sat in King's Landing for too long now, watching and waiting as things loomed empty in the secret. With Alyssa Targaryen aiding at Queen Alysanne's side and her sister Elinor of House Costayne also supporting his case, Rego knew he needed an edge to get what he came for.
Lord Rego and the King were locked in debate as they stood outside of the Jade Gates in Tyrosh, Lys. The Iron Bank of Braavos had made its loans to the kingdom and now wanted taxes, though Lord Celtigar had realized it would take time to stanch their demand for gold. Negotiations had been prolonged and costly in fine Myrish wines, Dornish spices, gilded platters filled with rare delights from across the realm. Finally, an agreement was reached – Myr would pay less but serve a stopgap to the bankers' demands for their substantial debt until a more favorable resolution could be negotiated between king and bank. Freed from immediate worry of bankruptcy should news of not meeting payments reach Pentos or other Free Cities willing to loan coin - should they want it - relief swept through court members like Aerea Targaryen and Jennis Templeton – Queen Alysanne wisely out wandering far away when things got gilded conversationally – while courtiers such as Robert I cheered at least part instant freedom from heavy Gold Chains that can lock up even those descended from Dragon Queens like Rhaena Targaryen with her kennelmaster Ronnal or some understewards if finances became strained. It seemed there were two paths forward now — one with policy paid by queenship’s coffers versus another via free will taken by lordships’ gambit at great cost: time that could have gone towards tasks better left undone than wasted in vast debate yet ultimately bringing resolution where warring factions wouldn't -- a course wise rulers often knew best but must surrender ego before being served too well. 
Jaehaerys was the latest agitator at the small council, claiming that he wanted to avoid oppressive taxes and serve justice where it was due. He believed that those with wealth needed to pay their fair share as well, so his pleas met with a squawk from Lord Rego Draz, a Myrish nobleman who had loaned money to King Jaehaerys I Targaryen in order to finance his costly ambitions. The kingdom had realized slowly how stanch its demand for gold could be and without some sort of stopgap measure like high taxes, they would be locked in debate on how best to pay their debts while still wanting free will for all citizens of Westeros. Prunella Celtigar said loudly too that she'd rather forgo her gilded lifestyle than want hard-earned coin from the farmer or rare goods from Lord Massey's merchant ships just so Myr and Lys weren't made poor by Dornish and Reach goods filling their markets with fine fabrics of cloth.
King Jaehaerys convened the small council and asked Grand Maester Benifer and Black Harren to bring forth his new idea of introducing hefty spice and silk taxes. He wished to use these increased revenues to build more schools, replenish markets with new goods, and for other such efforts that could encourage further growth across the realm; especially wanting to restore and fortify places like flea bottom oppressed by those who were wealthy.
His Grace, Jaehaerys I Targaryen had done his best to bring forth his plans to repair the crown's finances, and he wished to encourage others to build and replenish in a new and hefty way. He sent out a summons to follow him as he departed Dragonstone for his second wedding with Queen Alysanne Targaryen of House Targaryen. Silverwing followed eagerly behind His Grace as they separately slept at Flea Bottom before arriving in King's Landing. In the great hall of The Red Keep preparations were made for days on end, until finally all was ready for the long awaited ceremony. Noble Lords from every corner of the realm attended in honor of His Grace while member’s of House Targaryen brought Vermithor and Aerea with them from Dragonstone - making it clear that Rhaena was not forgotten by her family nor by their people.
King Jaehaerys I Targaryen was a popular ruler, and his Golden Wedding at the Red Keep in King’s Landing was a splendid affair which sent shockwaves of joy around every corner of the realm. His Grace was joined by Lord Rogar Baratheon and Septon Barth, witnessed by nobles from House Targaryen to Reynes of Castamere to Leffords at the Golden Tooth. It seemed all of Westeros had come to spend time with their King and Queen on this day as Piper's of Pinkmaiden played music for each event. Aerea Targaryen had been present since her father summoned her from Dragonstone, accompanied by her brother Rhaena and Albin Massey, Master-At-Arms. Alysanne Targaryen shone bright in an outfit befitting a queen while Septon Alfyn pronounced them man-and-wife officially binding them together before the Seven. The people rejoiced as they celebrated merrily in what seemed like it would last long into the night; until finally, Jaehaerys and Alysanne retired separately for bed - so that preparations could be made for their second wedding.
The royal wedding ceremony at Storm's End was underway, and Lord Rogar Baratheon was standing witness. Dowager Queen Alyssa and Garon ushered in Ronnal and Rhaena Targaryen as they made their way to see her siblings wed. Guests had come from near and far - some having even flown in from distant lands such as the Free Cities or The Reach while others hailed from Houses across Westeros. They had all gathered to be part of something spectacular; a joining of two ruling houses with Princess Aerea, daughter of King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, soon to be bride of Lord Rogar.
 The bells of Storm's End rang out across every corner of the realm as Queen Alysanne and her new husband, Lord Rogar Baratheon, made their way in from Bitterbridge to share in the joyous occasion of his second wedding followed by bedding and consummation of marriage at long last. Ravens flew off towards the Red Keep of King's Landing, Maegor's Holdfast carrying news that The Goodwife had proclaimed all would come to witness at see her siblings wed. Ser Joffrey Doggett and Rosamund Ball joined Prunella Celtigar and Jennis Templeton standing witness while bells took wing to every corner of Westeros proclaiming there a king again. Lord Rego insisted on disrobing the couple himself before carrying her to bridal bed where he did honors for king before entering first himself; when they emerged, hand-in-hand it was clear that love between them had been consummated bringing much needed respect back into the union. 
The royal progress of Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaena through the riverlands had been going on for months, with both delicate piety and violent determination. Everywhere they went, Jaehaerys or his son Maegor sent Ravens to proclaim the young man's claim, by now backed by Iron Throne in the Starry Sept and the powerful reins of King Aenys. But Lord Rogar Baratheon was not so quickly convinced; he insisted that his own daughter Prudence be wed too Kyg I Targaryen before acknowledging that alliance. The bells rang as Jaehaerys proclaimed it done: before long they took wing to Castle Castamere, where both would-be kings disrobed and carried their brides to their bridal beds; then did honours for king until at last their marriage was consummated in a happy union that ensured crucial respect for all corners of the realm.
Jaehaerys and Alysanne made their way to the Starry Sept, accompanied by Septon Moon's "High Lickspittle", where they announced that henceforth sibling marriage would be outlawed throughout the Seven Kingdoms. Though met with some bristling from those inclined to obey King Jaehaerys’s decree, ultimately all were compliant in letting the ruling stand. The pair then continued North on their progress, hastening towards the Wall where Jaehaerys had heard reports of troubled happenings beyond. Little did anyone know that a great upheaval was certain—and it would take much more than just Jaehaerys and Alysanne's cautionary efforts to make amends for any destruction yet to come.
Jaehaerys and Alysanne walked hand in hand through the inner yard of the Red Keep, both contented to be together despite the fact that their sibling marriage had just been outlawed by Septon Moon's 'High Lickspittle'. They believed implicitly in each other, trusting one another unconditionally. "Telling secrets is a charge," Jaehaerys said gently as if he was being kindly rather than scolding her. Alysanne closed her eyes and replied with a kind of sweet love, which caused him to brush his fingers along her face as an expression of admiration for this princess who wasn't afraid to let herself be gentle despite having been born into life of royal formality.
Seven, a party of three men and four women led by Queen Elinor of House Costayne, went forth to the Reach in armed travels. The testimony they could give up had claims to their nobility, but some took pity on them as common folks who looked shabbier and more threadbare with each mile that passed. As they crossed Lannisport, Elinor spoke fondly of good King Jaehaerys I Targaryen's reign and believed in the goodness of his successors; even though trust was hard to come by for smallfolk like her group. They could only rely on the kindness and sweet love given by gods for protection throughout their travels.
Jaehaerys, along with his father's court, went forth from Dragonstone to the incredibly far-reaching lands of the Reach. Upon arriving in Lannisport, many townsfolk were won over by Queen Alysanne and readily gave up their claims to nobility. However, despite her gracious nature, the common folks noted how much shabbier and more threadbare she was than the late king had been, leading some to doubt the goodness of his successors. Accompanying Queen Alysanne were Septon Baldrick, learned Septon Rollo, fierce old  Septon Alfyn, as well as four women; Septa Ysabel Mother Maris and Diminutive Septa Violante among them. Together they went forth to speak for Jaehaerys and performed miracles which earned them a favorable reputation within each town they passed through. In Gulltown's harbor alone where Sepltons taught generations of orphan girls about their vision for young king - it was famous around the realm - Aerea Targaryen of House Targaryen even heard tales from their travels from across Westeros thanks to Vermithor carried Ravens from every corner of its landmass.
Queen Alysanne and King Jaehaerys traveled the realm from King's Landing to Dragonstone, talking of piety, generosity and love. Everywhere they went people were won over by Queen Alysanne's famous goodness. To challenge her faith, Queen Alysanne invited three Septons — Oswyck, Baldrick and Barth — citing wise words crafted by learned Septon Rollo to test their faith in turn. While travelling the realm together, a fierce old Septon Alfyn accompanied them had been prominent among those who taught generations of orphan girls at the Arbor. With tales of miracles performed while they were talking and teaching citizens all over the Seven Kingdoms gaining attention everywhere they went, young king Jaehaerys flourished in fame equally as much as his beloved queen—"The Goodwife", as she was affectionately known—and Targaryens everywhere celebrated their royal duo once again.
Among the Targaryens, Septas, and Septons that had traveled from Andalos and Valyria to Westeros after the Doom of Valyria, there was talk about how to tame this loathsome land. Exceptionalists would cite piety, generosity, love and other such lessons as a way of standing ground against their enemies. Some even went so far as to lie in the hopes it would bring some unity amongst all the peoples of the realm. King Jaehaerys I Targaryen’s marriage between his daughter Aerea and Albin Massey was seen as an act of hope that peace could be crafted across Westeros. Yet when they arrived in King's Landing, it became apparent that Vermithor presented more than just a challenge - but also an opportunity for unity among House Targaryen and its supporters.
Septon Alfyn arrived at the Red Keep of King's Landing, summoned by Chief Steward Andalus. Seated stones away from the Iron Throne in Maegor's Holdfast, he was given an audience with His Grace, Jaehaerys Targaryen. He had been sent south to judge a grievous sin committed by a Tully hedge knight against House Reynes at Castamere - something that could no more be tamed than it could have been foretold in Valyria before the Doom. He listened intently as Jaehaerys spoke of justice and retribution, evaluating every subtle implication of his words like an exceptionally loathsome lie - for what he judged would truly bed the fate of those involved and none other.
Septon Baldrick had been called to the small village alongside a hedge knight, summoned by Septon Alfyn who lay in bed wrought with grievous sin. As soon as he arrived at Dragonstone, he was confronted by two quick-witted men and asked what they wanted from him. One of them, a small burly man spoke brusquely introducing himself as Poor Fellow, made it clear that Septon Baldrick was expected to confront House Targaryen for the claim upon their lands. The situation seemed grave and uncertain, but Baldrick was already known for being a cunning and fair septon -- traits perfect for this kind of predicament. With his warm smile and an unwavering sense of justice, there was no doubt he'd be able to resolve this issue quickly.
King Jaehaerys and Queen Alysanne were two of the most revered leaders in all of Westeros, and their rise up as sovereigns as they confronted unruly lords across realms was spoken of widely. As they spoke loudly, it became increasingly clear how weary The Seven Kingdoms were with the constant wars that had occurred ever since House Targaryen's Vermithor mounted on Albin Massey flew to Leffords at the Golden Tooth. Thus their quick-witted and burly Poor Fellow champion Aerea Targaryen, who claimed King’s Justice himself after Tom the Strummer declared his cause - played a part in its certain silence descending upon the realm. High Septon from Stonedance also took part in this announcement at Gulltown's harbor alongside Rhaena Targaryen and her kennelmaster Ronnal - understewards from Maidenpool, Lys and Tyrosh offered their support too.
The king and queen, Jaehaerys and Alysanne, faced a formidable challenge to restore the peace in their realm. Even though the events of rise up had occurred, there were many still weary of war that spoke loudly against their rule. Lord Rogar was one such voice who was not reconciled with the crown until a marriage between his daughter Queen Alyssa and King Jaehaerys' own daughter Rhaena remade into agreement. Meanwhile, The Goodwife of House Targaryen was ever diligent in her duties to impose new taxes which helped restore happiness in every corner of the realm as surrounding areas made light of such imposed taxes by House Targaryen.
King Jaehaerys had successfully reconciled Lord Rogar and Queen Alyssa and imposed new taxes on the realm, but his reign was not without its own troubles. His youngest daughter, Rhaena Targaryen, took it upon herself to take one last course of action to win over the people: a Royal Progress. She accompanied Lyman Lannister of Casterly Rock and visited many powerful houses like the Marbrands of Ashemark, Reynes of Castamere, Leffords at the Golden Tooth, and Vances at Wayfarer’s Rest as well as other families like The Goodwife's near Pinkmaiden. Everywhere she went she brought a sense of warmth with her which created an air of excitement in her presence; there were murmurs that they could feel their lust for dragons inside their hearts sparking up again. Although some may have been unwelcome too welcome Rhaena was careful enough to be extremely respectful when taking her leave making sure everyone felt comfortable before bidding them goodbye. Her progress was successful as many people eagerly awaited with anticipation for her return visit across every corner in Westeros.
Rhaena Targaryen and her royal entourage returned to the court at Casterly Rock, taking her leave from all of the great houses she had visited during her Royal Progress; the Marbrands of Ashemark, the Reynes of Castamere, the Leffords at the Golden Tooth, and even all the way down to visiting The Vances at Wayfarer’s Rest and finally ending with a stopover in Pinkmaiden. News of their visits had spread around Westeros like wildfire before they made it back to Dragonstone where King Aegon had suggested they return as he found himself in need to both threaten and banish those who would dare cause trouble for his kin. Here he set out on finding allies that could aid him in building an army that would be able occupy and rule their kingdom better than any other would-be kings or queens.
King Jaehaerys and House Targaryen had been asked to take the matter under consideration, of ceding control of three major regions in the realm and uniting them to solve the basic needs of widowed families. Many nobles threatened to banish King Jaehaerys should he not put their offer to him, so they could find a better future without having their homes occupied by others. The king suggested sending his best kennelmaster, Ronnal, alongside some understewards who would journey around the Seven Kingdoms to make sure that everyone knew that this was indeed what he wanted for those less fortunate. Rhaena Targaryen volunteered for the mission, hoping it would help her ease the trouble she found within herself after being banished from Dragonstone. With The Goodwife's blessing and Queen Elinor’s words encouraging her travels, off set Rhaena with twenty knights on Silverwing towards Black Harren where Diminutive Septa Violante attended all issues related to House Targaryens on-the-go.
His Grace, King Jaehaerys of House Targaryen had recently met with his sister Aerea at the ancient castle of Dragonstone to consider her proposal. After much reflecting and discussing the offer, both parties were of one mind that it was a fitting distinction to carve out a place for House Targaryen separate from Dragonstone but in courtesy still connected by writ runs to His Grace. The symbolic gesture of ceding Oldtown and extending their reach up north beyond the Wall seemed like an appropriate union in creating a united Westeros. With Queen Alysanne doing him service by visiting other Kings across the Seven Kingdoms, offering them similar arrangements as a widowed monarch, King Jaehaerys sent envoys far and wide to facilitate these changes accordingly.
Rhaena Targaryen, daughter of the late King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, was among those causing trouble in Dragonstone. Aerea had been sent to Oldtown by His Grace and so the two sisters were now separated, yet they were still of one mind when it came to restoring House Targaryen. As Jaehaerys attempted to throw his own weight behind a plan that might restore them with uncertain success, Rhaena could only give her own opinion on it: her own forces heretofore held in reserve would be enough to secure victory for their cause. However, as news from every corner of the realm began to reach Dragonstone about rebellions and would-be kings claiming their throne or vying for control over Westeros' destiny, uncertainty grew and all eyes turned towards Rhaena looking for answers about what this all meant for the House and its attempt at restoring itself back into its own kingdom.
King Jaehaerys had just thrown his temper tantrum at Rhaena and acknowledged Aerea Targaryen as the successor to the Iron Throne, when said rush decision caused some uncertainty with regards to her own future. So it was that soon after, King's Justice Albin Massey was dispatched hastily from Dragonstone to Leffords at the Golden Tooth with a small entourage of ladies-in-waiting and servants. Upon arriving at the West coast village, King's Justice Massey found much support for Queen Alysanne and Aerea who had already been called "Her Grace" by many subjects in both East and West. One of whom was stallboy Ronnal, speaking passionately about how Queen Alyssa knew it should be House Targaryen on The Iron Throne; how His Grace king Jaehaerys I Targaryen would restore justice across Westeros; and how his half sister Princess Aerea must not face any troubles out of uncertainties brought forward by her own hasty appointment.
King Jaehaerys and Queen Alysanne, had been named successor to the Iron Throne. Before they became ruler of Westeros they had a crisis - a test that would prove if they were wise, well-read and clever enough to do this task. They both voiced their opinion which hastily became acknowledged by the people around them — House Targaryen, Vemithor alongside Albin Massey and the Leffords at the Golden Tooth. But none was as important as Aerea Targaryen, King's Justice Jennis Templeton and King’s Maester Benifer Silverwing known for his prudence in such matters. 
The grand trappings of the House Targaryen and its would-be kings had already traveled far ahead of their procession by the time they reached Dragonstone. Everywhere, the people came out to cheer as Jaehaerys, Alysanne and their retinue competed with Maegor, Aenys and Queen Alyssa atop Vermithor for a spot in the royal parade. The air rang with laughter, music flowed from every corner and faces were dazzled by all manner of splendid splendor. Lord Rogar couldn't help but laugh at how happy everyone was to be back in Westeros after such trying times during the Crisis that proved just how wise Jaehaerys I Targaryen was indeed. He marveled at being able to witness first hand just how well-read and clever both Alysanne Targaryen and Maegor had become over this turbulent time; a joyous moment made all the more special as it shook off centuries of turmoil among rivaling Kings Justice's vying for control.
Queen Alysanne Targaryen looked back on her reign with pride. She had made it her purpose to bring music, comedy, and the joy of laughter throughout the realm. From Dragonstone to the Free Cities and from Flea Bottom to Oldtown and Braavos, she commissioned bards, harpists and fools. Tom the Strummer was a favorite among these new court singers; his ribald songs caused even old Lord Rogar's tight lips to smile with mirth. The Goodwife was brought in as Red Keep's first fool – though her tenure there was short-lived due to her mischievous mocking of certain nobles. But in that brief time, the castle rang with more than just battlecries - jokes were exchanged, melodies flowed through its halls in glorious harmony and the glitter of Alysanne’s happy court dazzled those who visited it.
King Jaehaerys was pleased when Queen Alysanne announced to the court that she was with child, and gifts were given in celebration. Before the War of the White Cloaks had taken her husband away from her, they both would spend days together at The Red Keep's walls, gazing away towards every corner of the realm. During their leisure times, Queen Alysanne made it her purpose to buy and commission for items for use in arts and decor for The Red Keep – such as a fine looking ornamental comb or hiring Tom the Strummer and made him a court singer; not forgetting to bring in a harpist who gave The Red Keep its first fool in glittering short-lived mocking ribald entertainment.
Ser Orryn Baratheon returned to Westeros with Rogar and tales of how he had crossed the Narrow Sea and taken service with the Archon at Tyrosh. Meanwhile Queen Alysanne gave birth to only girls, yet King Jaehaerys was still pleased with his heir. After marrying the Archon’s daughter, a buxom young woman with blue-green hair and a winsome manner, Ser Orryn was promoted to Master of Horse for its court. However things quickly turned south when the Archon's rivals killed him in battle and Ser Orryn lost his position as well. Forced to leave Tyrosh in search of employment elsewhere he sailed off to Myr where he joined the Maiden’s Men - a free company with an especially unsavory reputation - taking along his wife who provided services as practitioner of healing arts known as The Goodwife while they were part of it.
