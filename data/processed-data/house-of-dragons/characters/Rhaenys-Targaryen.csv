Biography,Background,"Rhaenys is the granddaughter of Jaehaerys I Targaryen, the daughter of Aemon Targaryen and Jocelyn Baratheon, and the first cousin of Viserys I Targaryen and Daemon Targaryen. She is named after her great-great-grandmother: Rhaenys Targaryen, the sister-wife of Aegon the Conqueror.Rhaenys married Corlys Velaryon, admiral of the Targaryen fleets and currently the wealthiest living man in Westeros, having grown rich on trading expeditions he personally made to the Further East of Essos. Rhaenys and Corlys have two children: their daughter Laena Velaryon and son Laenor Velaryon.Rhaenys's father Aemon died before her grandfather King Jaehaerys did, after which Jaehaerys made the decision to name his second son, Rhaenys's uncle Baelon Targaryen, as his heir. This proved controversial, since according to traditional inheritance law based on primogeniture, a lord's daughter stands ahead of his younger brother in the line of succession. As a result, Rhaenys is called ""The Queen Who Never Was"". Baelon himself died a few years later, also while Jaehaerys was still alive, leaving two rival male claimants to the Iron Throne: Rhaenys's own son Laenor (based on primogeniture), or Rhaenys's first cousin Viserys (the son of her uncle Baelon, and thus an unbroken male line). Fearing a civil war, Jaehaerys solved the issue by holding the Great Council of 101 AC in which all the lords of Westeros held a vote, and elected Viserys as heir to the throne. Jaehaerys died of old age a few years later and Viserys ascended to the throne.House of the Dragon | Official Website for the HBO Series | HBO.com"
Biography,House of the Dragon: Season 1,"At the Heir's Tournament held to celebrate the impending birth of Viserys's son Baelon, Rhaenys comments scathingly to her husband Corlys that the knights participating are as ""green as summer grass"" and none have actually seen real battle. When Viserys's wife Aemma Arryn dies from childbirth complications and Baelon does not long survive her, Rhaenys is among the family members and courtiers present at their joint funeral.Rhaenys and her husband meet with King Viserys and propose a marriage alliance between the widower monarch and their daughter Laena, uniting the greatest surviving houses of Old Valyria. While Viserys is very hesitant at the idea of marrying a child, he understands the importance of producing more heirs to secure his line. Rhaenys later speaks to Rhaenyra—Viserys's only surviving child and designated heir to the Iron Throne—and gives her a blunt lesson in politics: as much as the lords of Westeros have sworn to uphold Rhaenyra's position as her father's heir, she knows from personal experience that such oaths can easily be reneged on, and that having a woman on the throne is a much more controversial prospect than the young princess realizes.Viserys arrives at the Velaryon island stronghold of High Tide to negotiate with Corlys, who had previously resigned as Master of Ships on the king's Small Council over Viserys's decision to marry Alicent Hightower rather than Laena. Rhaenys seems concerned at the apparently ill health of her cousin, but Viserys dismisses the matter and proposes that his daughter Rhaenyra should marry Laena's brother Laenor, and their firstborn child would someday inherit the Iron Throne. Both sides agree to the terms, but Rhaenys privately confesses to her husband that Laenor's secret preference for men may only cause further complications. She also admits that she made peace long ago with the fact that she wasn't chosen as queen."
