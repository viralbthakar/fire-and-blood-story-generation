Synopsis,In the Stepstones,"On a beach of one of the islands, Craghas Drahar, prince-admiral of the Triarchy forces, executes shipwrecked Westerosi sailors by nailing them to posts on the beach to either drown or be slowly eaten alive by the crabs drawn by the tide."
Synopsis,In the Crownlands,"As King Viserys and his Small Council discuss the recent death of Ser Ryam Redwyne, Lord Corlys Velaryon furiously storms into the chamber, raging that the Triarchy forces have now sunk four Westerosi ships, including one from the Velaryon fleet, and demands action, insisting he be allowed to use the Royal Fleet to clear out the Stepstones. Ser Otto Hightower and Lord Lyman Beesbury argue against starting a war with the Free Cities, who are financing Drahar's occupation, while Viserys explains that he has sent envoys to the Triarchy's enemies in Pentos and Volantis with the prospect of an alliance against their common foe, but Corlys retorts that further inaction will only strengthen the belief in the Free Cities that Viserys is weak, as evidenced by the fact he has done nothing to end Daemon's illegal occupation of Dragonstone for almost half a year. Rhaenyra speaks up, suggesting that the Velaryon fleet, backed by Targaryen dragonriders, could easily reclaim the Stepstones (a suggestion that meets with Corlys's approval), but at Otto's urging, Viserys overrides her suggestion and dispatches her with Ser Harrold Westerling to consider the prospective replacements for Ser Ryam.In Maegor's Holdfast, Rhaenyra watches as Ser Harrold presents various knights to take Ser Ryam's place on the Kingsguard. Rhaenyra is dismissive of most of them, asking Harrold if any have seen actual combat, rather than just tourney fighting. The sole candidate who has is Ser Criston Cole, who explains he has previously fought Dornish raiders; despite Otto's protests that a more politically valuable candidate should be chosen, Rhaenyra insists that she wants her father defended by a knight who can actually fight and picks Criston for the vacancy.In his private chambers, Viserys talks with Alicent Hightower, while pondering over a model of Valyria, expressing his hopes to try and match old Valyria's glory. The conversation turns to Rhaenyra, with Viserys admitting his uncertainty of how to speak with Rhaenyra in the wake of her mother Aemma's death. Alicent advises Viserys to reach out to his daughter to bridge the gap (though she admits she hasn't mentioned her dalliances with Viserys to Rhaenyra for fear of her reaction). Alicent offers the same advice back to Rhaenyra when they go to pray at the Grand Sept.Later that afternoon, in the Red Keep's gardens, Viserys meets with Corlys and his wife, Princess Rhaenys Targaryen; Viserys and Corlys exchange apologies over their terse words in the Small Council chamber, but Corlys repeats his advice of not allowing the Free Cities to think Viserys weak, firstly by striking back at the Stepstones, and by a marriage between Viserys and their daughter Laena, uniting House Targaryen's dragons and House Velaryon's fleet to prove the strength of his reign. Viserys is wary of a new marriage so soon after Aemma's death, but Rhaenys reminds him it will be expected of him to remarry and produce more heirs to strengthen his line. Rhaenyra reiterates the same advice and Grand Maester Mellos also supports the union, remarking that it would go a long way to healing the rift between Houses Targaryen and Velaryon left by the Great Council of 101 AC, though Otto seethes at Corlys's ambition.The next day, Rhaenyra and Rhaenys watch from a balcony of the Red Keep, as Viserys walks with Laena. Viserys is visibly uncomfortable about potentially marrying a child, while Laena is more interested in hearing about Viserys's experience as the last rider of Balerion, as well as pondering the whereabouts of Vhagar. Rhaenys bluntly tells Rhaenyra that whoever her father takes as a wife, should Viserys have a son, the men of Westeros will expect that son to be his heir, not Rhaenyra. Rhaenys notes that given her own passing over, the men of Westeros will not accept a woman on the Iron Throne.Later that evening, Viserys dines privately in Alicent's company, where she commiserates with him over his reluctance at wedding a new queen and gifts him a repaired model of a dragon for his miniature of Valyria. Otto interrupts the meal to inform the king that he has called an emergency meeting of the Small Council. One of the Dragonkeepers is present at the meeting, who informs Viserys that an egg has been stolen from the Dragonpit. The culprit is none other than Daemon, who left a missive announcing his intention to take his mistress Mysaria as his second wife, flippantly inviting his brother and council to attend, and as Mysaria is now with child, Daemon wishes to place a dragon egg in the infant's cradle in keeping with Targaryen tradition. Viserys, furious at this latest display of insolence by his younger brother, declares his intention to retake Dragonstone from Daemon, but Otto insists the king cannot risk himself, warning that Daemon is unpredictable and has fortified the island and castle with a private army of his gold cloaks, and volunteers himself to lead efforts to expel Daemon from Dragonstone. Rhaenyra is also left angry when she learns the egg Daemon had stolen was the one she had picked out for her little brother Baelon. Before departing for Dragonstone, Otto meets with Alicent in private and urges her to continue her liaisons with the king.Ser Otto Hightower's forces, consisting of himself, Ser Harrold Westerling, Ser Criston Cole, and twenty of his household guard, arrive on Dragonstone. Daemon, accompanied by Mysaria and a detachment of his gold cloaks, intercept them on the bridge leading to the castle. Otto relays Viserys's demands that Daemon is to relinquish the stolen dragon egg and the castle, disband his private army, and banish Mysaria. Daemon refuses, insulting Otto and Criston in the process, insisting he is merely following his house's traditions. When Otto threatens Mysaria, Daemon draws Dark Sister, prompting both sides to draw their own weapons, though Otto orders his men to sheathe their weapons when Caraxes appears to defend his master.Before the tension can spill into open conflict, Rhaenyra arrives unannounced on Syrax. She dismounts and brushes past a protesting Otto to confront Daemon personally. Rhaenyra dares her uncle to kill her if he truly wishes to reclaim his former status as her father's heir, but Daemon cannot bring himself to murder his niece in cold blood, even for his old position, and begrudgingly tosses Rhaenyra the dragon egg before retreating with Mysaria and his retinue back into the castle. Rhaenyra turns the egg over to the care of the Dragonkeepers.Within the castle, Mysaria, who reveals she was not pregnant, Daemon having concocted the claim to spite his brother, berates Daemon for provoking Viserys, stating that while he enjoys a degree of protection as the king's younger brother, she does not and would likely end up the one who pays the price for Daemon's antics. Daemon assures Mysaria that he will protect her.With Otto and his men having gone, Viserys meets with Lord Lyonel Strong for an impartial opinion about a prospective marriage to Laena Velaryon. Although Lyonel acknowledges Viserys's discomfort at marrying a child, he adds that strengthening an alliance with House Velaryon could temper Corlys's bitterness over the Great Council's decision, unify the last descendants of Valyria, and ensure the Crown has access to the Velaryon fleet should the situation in the Stepstones deteriorate into open war. The meeting is interrupted by Grand Maester Mellos informing Viserys of Rhaenyra's departure and return from Dragonstone.The Kingsguard escort Rhaenyra to her father's chambers, where he angrily chides his daughter for taking off without his leave and risking her life, though he does concede that only she could have  recovered the egg and ended the situation with Daemon bloodlessly. They speak about Aemma for a time, Viserys noting that Rhaenyra has inherited a lot from her, before reluctantly broaching the subject of a prospective remarriage. Viserys insists that he cannot replace Aemma, but with only Rhaenyra as his heir, were anything to happen to her, House Targaryen would come to an end, and though Viserys insists he will not replace Rhaenyra as his heir, even were his new wife to give him sons, he must ensure the continuation of their line.At a Small Council meeting the next morning, Viserys declares his intention to marry Alicent Hightower. Only Otto looks pleased with the King's decision; the rest of the Small Council stand in silent shock, while Alicent averts her eyes from Rhaenyra. Furious at this latest insult to his family, Corlys storms out of the chamber. Rhaenyra follows him, disgusted and hurt by her father and friend keeping this from her.Enraged at the snubbing of his daughter by Viserys, Corlys invites Daemon Targaryen to his castle High Tide. Corlys rages at Viserys's disregard and lack of respect for his family and loyal service, citing Daemon's own fall from Viserys's good graces as proof that they share a common cause, being men of action forced to make their own way in the world who have never received the due respect or appreciation for their efforts. Although Daemon chides Corlys for speaking disrespectfully of his brother, he is intrigued when Corlys proposes a joint expedition between them to eliminate the Crabfeeder, clear out the Triarchy forces from the Stepstones, and simultaneously claim wealth and glory for themselves, while proving their value to the dissenters at Viserys's court."
