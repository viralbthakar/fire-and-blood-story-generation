Synopsis,Laena's funeral,"At Driftmark, King Viserys I Targaryen and his entire royal court attend the funeral of Laena Velaryon, along with the devastated members of House Velaryon. Laena's uncle Vaemond Velaryon delivers the eulogy in High Valyrian, in which he includes several pointed remarks about Velaryon blood remaining pure while glancing at Rhaenyra Targaryen's alleged sons with Laena's brother Laenor, who look nothing like him. While Laena's husband Daemon Targaryen is somber at her death, he cannot help but start giggling at Vaemond's pettiness in bringing this up now of all times. The ceremony ends with Laena's stone sarcophagus being dropped over a coastal cliff into the sea, to rest beside her ancestors.The bereaved court then gathers at a cliffside courtyard of High Tide castle for the wake, which is filled with long awkward silences and strained conversations: this event has forced Rhaenyra and Alicent Hightower's families to meet in one place again right after Rhaenyra removed herself from King's Landing to Dragonstone, due to the (accurate) rumors after the birth of her boy Joffrey that all three of her sons are actually Harwin Strong's bastards. Moreover, Laena's death has spurred Daemon to return to Westeros for the first time in a decade, along with his daughters by Laena who have never met the rest of their family. Also gathered at the castle for the funeral are all of the dragons currently bonded to riders (which are big enough to mount): Daemon's Caraxes, Rhaenyra's Syrax, Laenor's Seasmoke, Rhaenys's Meleys, and also Aegon's Sunfyre and Helaena's Dreamfyre. Laena's Vhagar, apparently bereaved, rests elsewhere on the dunes of the beach.Alicent and her supporters are the only ones who have gained from recent events: after Larys Strong secretly had his own father Lyonel Strong and his other brother Harwin killed in a fire, he has been made the new Lord of Harrenhal and Alicent's father Otto Hightower has returned to take Lyonel's place as Hand of the King. Alicent herself is disgusted with Larys's barely contained pride.Rhaenyra's eldest son Jacaerys Velaryon is old enough to realize that Harwin was his father, and privately tells his mother how upsetting it is that they can't openly mourn him without drawing suspicion to themselves. Corlys Velaryon goes to Rhaenyra's second son Lucerys Velaryon and explains that because Jace will one day inherit the Iron Throne itself, Luke will one day inherit his own title as Lord of the Tides and head of House Velaryon. Luke tearfully says that he doesn't want it, because he would only become Lord of Driftmark after Laenor and Corlys were dead. Laena's traumatized daughters Baela and Rhaena Targaryen meet their grandmother Rhaenys for the first time and she consoles them. Rhaenyra tells Jace that despite their private loss of Harwin, he should go and comfort to his cousins. Jace walks over but no one knows what to say, so Baela and Jace just silently hold hands. Rhaenys glares at Jace and Luke, who she knows are not really her biological grandchildren. Laenor himself is stunned by his sister's tragic death, and has waded out into the surf on the beach below to be closer to her resting place. Corlys angrily tells Laenor's lover Qarl Correy to retrieve his ""patron"" from his embarrassing behavior.Alicent's children are also present but detached from the events: Aegon is visibly bored and gets increasingly drunk on the wine being passed around while lecherously eyeing the serving girls. Helaena is infatuated with capturing a spider, while muttering cryptically to herself about ""dragons of flesh"" weaving threads of green and black. Aegon remarks to his younger brother Aemond that he is annoyed their mother recently announced he is betrothed to marry his sister Helaena (in incestuous Targaryen tradition), because he thinks she's an idiot. Alicent apparently announced this union right after declining Rhaenyra's suggestion to betroth Helaena to her son Jace. Aemond responds that if he was betrothed to Helaena he would fulfill his duty, and Aegon shouldn't insult his own future queen. Aemond is the only one of Alicent's family to show even a hint of sympathy for the Velaryon side of the family, when he briefly glances over at the grieving Baela and Jace and considers saying something, but he silently backs away.King Viserys then goes to speak with his brother Daemon, whom he exiled for a second time a decade ago. Viserys still loves Daemon and asks him to return home to King's Landing, and let their prior differences stay in the past. Daemon says his home is Pentos, and that of his children. Viserys urges that there is still a place for Daemon at his side in the royal court and offers anything Daemon might need, but Daemon cuts him off. Not comfortably expressing grief, Daemon stammers out that he needs nothing and turns to leave. Otto Hightower, now restored as Hand of the King, offers token condolences as Daemon passes, but he just glares back and says that a leech's hunger is never satisfied. Throughout this, Rhaenyra eyes her uncle Daemon from across the courtyard, whom she was once infatuated with until he abruptly left ten years ago. The skies begin to darken as dusk arrives and everyone begins to retire for the evening. Viserys is exhausted, and Laena's death in childbirth clearly reminds him of his first wife Aemma Arryn's similar death years before. With her on his mind, he accidentally says to Alicent, ""I'm going to bed, Aemma,"" though Ser Harrold Westerling gently corrects him by asking ""Shall I see after Queen Alicent, Your Grace?"" - Alicent is quietly unnerved by this. Gathering all the children to leave, Aegon has passed out drunk in a stairway from all the wine he was drinking, so his grandfather Otto wakes him with a stiff kick and drags him to his feet."
Synopsis,Night on Driftmark,"Alone in front of the fireplace that night, Corlys and Rhaenys have a tense discussion. Rhaenys complains that Laena wanted to return to Westeros to be with her family but Daemon opposed it, and wonders that if their own maesters had attended Laena's childbirth she might have survived. Corlys assures that the surgeons in Pentos are as well trained as they are at Driftmark, and she should not lay blame for an act of the gods. Rhaenys says she wonders if the gods are punishing them for their pride, and calls out Corlys for his attempts to put a Velaryon on the Iron Throne. Corlys says that as a loyal husband he wants to restore what was taken from Rhaenys at the Great Council of 101 AC, but she sharply observes it wasn't her rights but his own ambition which he wanted to fulfill. Not denying it but reflective, Corlys stares into the fireplace and gravely ponders what this brief mortal life is, if not the pursuit of legacy. Rhaenys then comes to the point: she wants rule of Driftmark to pass to Laena's elder daughter Baela instead of to Luke. Here in private she tells Corlys they should drop all pretense: they both know that Laenor isn't the real father of Rhaenyra's sons and that they are not of Velaryon blood. She doesn't care about the Iron Throne and is even open to Jace inheriting it someday (as it would still be through his mother, Rhaenyra), but she wants him to declare Baela heir to Driftmark instead of Luke while the royal court is still all gathered at their castle. Corlys says he can't bring himself to put a darker shadow over those innocent boys than there already is, as disinheriting Luke for Baela would immediately cast doubt on Jace's inheritance to the Iron Throne. Rhaenys says that Laena's daughters are her legacy and they must honor that, but Corlys says that history does not remember blood: it remembers names.Outside the castle, Rhaenyra and Daemon take a moonlit walk along the beach, talking through their recent mutual losses and their tension at being apart for a decade. Rhaenyra worries that Laenor is so bereaved he will be useless to her now: they both knew their marriage was a farce, but at least she put effort into maintaining appearances. Rhaenyra explains that she and Laenor actually did try to conceive children several times, but to no avail, and thus she had three sons who (she is convinced) are all Harwin's. Rhaenyra worries that she should have forbidden Harwin from returning to the Riverlands, as she believes in the curse said to have been over Harrenhal since the Targaryen Conquest. Daemon scoffs that the alleged curse is just a superstition, that Otto or Alicent would gladly exploit, though Rhaenyra says she doesn't think Alicent herself is capable of cold-blooded murder (and indeed, she actually didn't order Harwin's death). Rhaenyra moves on to accuse Daemon of abandoning her for ten years, leaving when she was just a child and needed him. Daemon says he left because she was a child: he was sparing her from the dangers of being around him. Rhaenyra tells him to look at how her life played out without him, a droll tragedy. She asks if Daemon really loved Laena, and pained he says that they were happy enough, which Rhaenyra says is in and of itself a great achievement in this world. She says she is sorry for his loss, but he tells her he shouldn't be, because at least he is allowed to publicly mourn Laena in a way she can't publicly mourn Harwin. Consoling each other in their shared grief, Rhaenyra pulls Daemon closer and says she isn't a child anymore, and begins to kiss him. They take shelter in a nearby wrecked boat and disrobe each other by moonlight, and proceed to tenderly make love. On a different part of the beach, young Aemond Targaryen has snuck out of the castle and found Laena's dragon Vhagar asleep in the dunes. Nearly the size of a sand dune herself, Vhagar is the oldest and largest living dragon, twice the size of even Caraxes and last of the original three dragons from the Targaryen Conquest. Aemond approaches cautiously and puts a hand on the rope netting leading to her saddle. Vhagar awakens but senses that he is a prince of Targaryen blood and backs down. Aemond puts his hand on the rope again and starts to actually try to mount Vhagar, however, at which she growls and starts building up fire in the back of her throat to immolate him with. Aemond bravely stands his ground, and like firmly giving commands to a horse, shouts verbal commands in High Valyrian for Vhagar to heel and obey. None can know the mind of a dragon, but after a mysterious moment she relents and allows him to climb to her saddle. He then gives her the order to fly, and she launches into the night sky. Aemond nearly falls off the saddle several times because he isn't properly secured but eventualy he manages to level out and master the flight, taking Vhagar on a circle around the castle before landing again, a bonded dragon-rider.Baela and Rhaena, meanwhile, noticed that someone ""stole"" Vhagar and wake Jace and Luke to come and investigate. The four younger children intercept Aemond just as he is returning to the castle through the tunnel leading to the beach. Rhaena angrily says Vhagar was her mother's dragon and hers to claim, but Aemond says if she wanted her she should have claimed her already. Now filled with the boundless confidence of mastering not just any dragon but the largest in the world, Aemond says that if she wants a dragon of her own she can ask Rhaenyra's sons to give her a pig like they gave him, as it would suit her more. Rhaena charges Aemond but he easily shoves her aside, causing Baela to punch him in the face, and he quickly punches her back. A brawl breaks out between the children: Aemond punches Luke so hard he breaks his nose, but then the other children join in, and all four manage to pin Aemond to the ground, before he eventually brings his larger size to bear and breaks free. Bloodied, he stands and grabs Luke by the throat with one hand while holding a large rock in the other to strike him with, and declares he will feed them to his dragon, so the ""bastards"" can die in flames like their father did. Luke doesn't understand, saying his father is still alive, at which Aemond turns to Jace and remarks he doesn't know, and addresses him as ""Lord Strong"". Jace, who is old enough to understand, is so insulted that he draws a knife he had brought with him. He charges Aemond with it, but he manages to knock the blade from his hand and Jace to the ground. Turning his attention to the older boy and advancing on him with rock in hand, he doesn't notice Luke circling around to recover the discarded knife. Just before Aemond can bash him with the rock, Jace distracts him by flinging sand into his face, then Luke charges from the side uses the knife to slash Aemond across the left side of his face, through his left eye. Aemond is left screaming on the ground just as Ser Harrold and the other Kingsguard arrive."
Synopsis,An eye for an eye,"The adults of House Targaryen are roused to the main Hall of Nine in the aftermath of the fight between the children. Viserys arrives and is furious with the Kingsguard for not protecting princes of the royal blood, to which Ser Criston protests they didn't expect to defend the princes from each other. Maester Kelvyn stitches up the horrific slash across Aemond's face and tells Alicent that his left eye is lost. Horrified, Alicent begins to panic and slaps Aegon for being drunk and asleep instead of defending his brother (even though Aemond snuck away in the middle of the night and no one knew where he was). Corlys and Rhaenys enter and demand to know what happened, followed by Rhaenyra who rushes to her more mildly injured sons. When she asks what happened, all of the children began talking over each other, Aemond saying the other children attacked him and the other children saying they were only defending themselves. Viserys shouts for silence, and Jace whispers to Rhaenyra that Aemond called them bastards. Viserys asks Aemond to tell the truth of what happened, but Alicent angrily interjects that his son has been maimed and Rhaenyra's sons are responsible, and nothing else matters. Rhaenyra says Aemond's maiming was a regrettable accident, but Alicent says her sons brought a knife to the fight intending to kill Aemond, which Rhaenyra denies saying they only brought out the knife when they were forced to defend themselves. Rhaenyra says that Aemond made ""vile insults"" against her sons that they are bastards, and questioning their legitimacy is the highest of treasons. She demands that Aemond be ""sharply questioned"" to find out where he heard these slanders. Viserys asks where the boys' father Laenor is, to which Alicent snidely remarks that he must be ""entertaining"" his squires.Viserys turns to Aemond and asks where he heard the accusation that Rhaenyra's sons are bastards, but after a tense moment looking towards his mother, he says that he heard it from his other brother Aegon. Viserys turns to his eldest son and asks where he himself heard this, but in a deft response, rather than blame his mother Aegon implores Viserys that ""We know father. Everyone knows"", and it is obvious from just looking at them. Distraught, with his voice breaking Viserys commands that they are one family and must cease this infighting. He orders them all to make their apologies and show good will to each other by command of their king.After a pause, Alicent says this is insufficient, as apologies will not restore Aemond's eye - but the debt can still be paid by taking out the eye of one of Rhaenyra's sons. Viserys is aghast, but Alicent commands Criston Cole to bring her the eye of Lucerys. Enraged, she says that Luke can pick which eye he loses, which is more choice than he gave to her son. Criston hesitates, protesting his oath as her sworn shield and protector does not extend to maiming others of the royal family at her command. Viserys insists that the matter is finished, and from now onward anyone who dares to question the legitimacy of Rhaenyra's sons will have their tongue cut out. Shaking with grief and fury, Alicent refuses to accept this: as Viserys turns to leave she pulls the Valyrian steel dagger from his belt and rushes across the room towards Luke. Just before she can reach him, however, Rhaenyra blocks her and grabs both her wrists. As they continue to grapple, the panicked onlookers circle up around them; Criston tries to support Alicent, only for Daemon to intercept him as Ser Harrold shouts at the other Kingsguard to hold the crowd back, including Hightower and Velaryon men-at-arms drawing their swords. Alicent shouts accusations at Rhaenyra which she has bottled up for years: she has only ever done what was expected of her, upholding her family and the law, while Rhaenyra was always free to do as she pleases (Alicent entered into an arranged marriage to a man old enough to be her father, while Rhaenyra blatantly had a love affair outside of marriage producing three obviously bastard sons). This is the last straw for Alicent, that now Rhaenyra can even have her son maim Alicent's son and once again face no repercussions. Alicent shouts that Rhaenyra has no sense of duty or sacrifice, even as Viserys and Otto demand she put down the blade. Rhaenyra coldly answers back that it must have been exhausting for Alicent to hide beneath the cloak of her own righteousness, but by attacking her like this, everyone now sees Alicent as she truly is. Alicent makes a final push to break free of her grip, and ends up slashing Rhaenyra along her left arm. Seeing the blood, even Alicent is horrified at how out of control the situation has become. She drops the dagger and starts coming to her senses. The room falls silent, then Aemond steps forward and despite the grievous injury to his face calmly tells his mother not to mourn him, for it was a fair exchange: he may have lost an eye, but he gained a dragon. Later, Alicent's father Otto visits her in her private chamber. She is humiliated and ashamed by her attempted attack on Rhaenyra and her son, which now guarantees Viserys will always side with Rhaenyra over her. She fears for her reputation as well, as word must already be spreading that she has gone mad with grief. Otto is filled with pride, however, saying that they are playing an ugly game but up until this moment he didn't know if Alicent had the determination to win it. Otto says that young Aemond was correct, because winning the largest dragon in the world to their side was well worth the cost of his eye and the temporary damage to Alicent's reputation. He advises her to humble herself to Viserys and cite her grief as a mother for inflaming her passions, and in time he will forgive her because it is all he can bring himself to do. For now, they will bide their time.The next day Viserys, Alicent, and their entourage leave on their ship back to King's Landing, while their children leave on the backs of their now three dragons: Aegon on Sunfyre, Helaena on Dreamfyre, and Aemond on Vhagar. Larys Strong approaches Alicent on the deck of the ship and offers that if she still seeks revenge for Aemond's eye, he can easily arrange some sort of assassination through his spy network. Alicent politely declines, saying that his help has not gone unnoticed and she will have need of it in the future, but now is the time for patience and discretion, which he accepts."
Synopsis,Removing Laenor,"In Rhaenyra's chamber, Laenor arrives as Maester Kelvyn finishes stitching the slash on Rhaenyra's arm. Laenor is ashamed, saying that he has fought dreadful enemies in war but couldn't defend his own sister from death and could not defend Rhaenyra. She informs him that Aemond called their sons bastards. Laenor admits that he has failed Rhaenyra, that he tried to make their marriage work even though they both knew it was a sham, and that he truly loves their boys, but maybe he has not loved them enough. Rhaenyra says she did hope that the few times she and Laenor lay together it would have produced a child, and then things may have been different. Laenor says he hates the gods for making him as he is, but Rhaenyra gently insists that he is an honorable man with a good heart, a rare thing which he shouldn't be ashamed about. Laenor says that Ser Qarl is returning soon to the renewed fighting in the Stepstones, but he will not go with him: instead he will rededicate himself to Rhaenyra, to strengthening her claim to the throne and raising their sons as princes of the realm. He promises he will be the husband she deserves.Rhaenyra then watches Viserys and Alicent's ship leave from the shore, while speaking to her uncle Daemon in High Valyrian. She has realized that conflict is now inevitable and says that she needs him to strengthen her side. He says that they could only marry if Laenor were dead, and she says she knows this.Daemon then discretely meets with Laenor's lover Qarl Correy at the docks of Driftmark. He remarks to him that he is a lowborn knight with a lord's expensive tastes, but there are places across the sea where the name a man was born with doesn't matter, only how much gold he has. Qarl asks what Daemon wants in return, to which he says, ""a quick death, one with witnesses"". Rhaenyra's conversation with Daemon continues: she does not want to be a tyrant and rule through terror, but he says tyrants only rule through terror. Daemon says that a king or queen must cultivate love and respect, but if they are not feared they are powerless. Rhaenyra says she does love Laenor, but Daemon says that if she loves him she will ""set him free"". She says their enemies will whisper she was responsible for Laenor's death, but Daemon says they want them to whisper: they can't prove anything and it will make her enemies fear what she and Daemon are capable of.Back in High Tide castle, Daemon discretely sneaks up on one of the guards and snaps his neck. In the main hall, Qarl angrily approaches Laenor claiming he has always looked down on him, and draws his sword. Laenor draws his sword as well and they begin to fight in front of Laenor's frightened servant, who rushes out saying he will summon the guards. When the guards return along with Laenor's parents, they are horrified to find his corpse shoved head-first into the fireplace, horrifically burned beyond recognition. Rhaenys howls in anguish while Corlys furiously berates his guards for allowing such an atrocity to happen.Rhaenyra and her uncle Daemon then marry each other in a Valyrian rite ceremony on the beach, a small gathering witnessed by their children and Maester Gerardys. Late in the night, however, a cloaked figure runs to the beach on Driftmark where Qarl Correy is waiting for him with a rowboat: Laenor Velaryon, his head shaved so he won't be recognized for his Valyrian silver hair. Daemon and Qarl helped Laenor fake his death, swapping his clothes with the guard that Daemon killed and then burned. Rhaenyra and Daemon ""set him free"" from the arranged marriage he was trapped in, so Rhaenyra and Daemon could enter into a marriage alliance with each other, and Laenor could pursue the life he wanted with Qarl adventuring in the Stepstones."
