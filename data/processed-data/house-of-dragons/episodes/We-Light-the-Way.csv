Synopsis,Near Runestone,"Prince Daemon Targaryen confronts his estranged wife, Lady Rhea Royce, while she is out hunting alone near her family's castle of Runestone. Rhea mockingly asks Daemon if he has come to consummate their marriage, or if his brother has finally expelled him from court after disinheriting Daemon in favor of a girl. Rhea asks if Daemon intends to murder his niece Rhaenyra to reclaim his former position, only to realize that Daemon has returned to the Vale solely to kill her, since as a widower, he would be free to marry again, and could easily wed his niece in the tradition of House Targaryen to reclaim his former status. Realizing her peril, Rhea tries to grab her bow, only for Daemon to spook her horse into throwing her from the saddle. Rhea is badly hurt in the fall when her horse collapses on top of her; Daemon briefly checks Rhea before making to leave, seemingly content her injuries will kill her. Rhea then taunts him that he can't ""finish"" her, however, at which Daemon picks up a large stone and advances to kill her."
Synopsis,On Driftmark,"King Viserys sails to Driftmark, the island seat of House Velaryon, to propose a marriage between his daughter, Princess Rhaenyra, and Ser Laenor Velaryon, Lord Corlys Velaryon's heir. He is accompanied by Lord Lyonel Strong, recently appointed as the new Hand of the King to replace Ser Otto Hightower. The king's health is not helped by the journey, as he becomes seasick on the way and develops a light cough. They land and make the overland trip to High Tide, Lord Corlys's fabulous new castle built with the wealth from his famous voyages, located on a tidal island. They find no welcoming party in the courtyard, only Laenor sparring with his companion Ser Joffrey Lonmouth. Laenor's sister Laena Velaryon then comes from the gates and politely invites them in, informing them that Corlys was too ""tired"" from a recent voyage to meet them there. Lyonel is insulted that Corlys would make the king wait like this, but Viserys waves it aside: Corlys's pride was deeply wounded when Viserys declined a marriage pact with his daughter Laena, so these games are to be expected if they are to re-secure his allegiance, and they might as well get on with it. Laena, at least, is happy to see her cousin Rhaenyra, and departs with her for breakfast.Viserys proceeds to the Hall of Nine, the main throne room which his filled with fantastical artifacts from the far corners of the Known world that Corlys brought back from his sea travels. Corlys receives Viserys and is clearly enjoying himself, for the king to come to him to request a marriage alliance to his son, but he stops short of outright arrogance. He also compliments Lord Lyonel on his recent promotion as Hand, a back-handed dig at his rival Otto Hightower's fall from grace, and informs them of Lady Rhea Royce's death. Corlys's wife Rhaenys then enters the hall, still in riding gear from her dragon. Both sides are outwardly polite but the unspoken truth is that Viserys has come to beg them to unite back with the crown, and they make a show of false modesty. Rhaenys is genuinely surprised and concerned when she notices that her cousin has lost two fingers on his left hand, though he insists he is fine. Both sides quickly agree on terms: the firstborn child of Laenor and Rhaenyra, regardless of gender, will inherit the Iron Throne. Corlys also asks that, per Westerosi tradition, their children will take their father's surname. Bemused, Viserys says he can't allow the Targaryen dynasty to end with him just because he had a daughter, but as a compromise, he offers that Laenor's children will take the surname ""Velaryon"", but after that Laenor's grandchildren will have to go back to using the surname ""Targaryen"". Corlys finds this an ""equitable"" solution, and the marriage pact is finalized. Viserys's cough gets worse and Corlys starts to show concern, but Viserys says he is just tired and leaves.Later, Rhaenyra and her cousin Laenor are sent on a courtship walk along the nearby beach. Rhaenyra, however, is aware that both she and Laenor are in love with other people, and that he is no more enthusiastic about this marriage pact than she is. In a friendly conversation, she proposes a mutual arrangement: they will perform their duty for their respective families to marry and produce heirs, but otherwise they will both continue having their own private romantic relationships.Back at the castle, Corlys expresses concern to Rhaenys that perhaps he was a little too haughty with Viserys, but Rhaenys says that Viserys knew full well what to expect when he came there. She feels it was Viserys who chose to humiliate himself, a king coming to his vassal's castle to beg for a marriage alliance. Corlys goes on to ask where Rhaenyra and Laenor have gone, and when Rhaenys says that they went for a walk along the beach, he eagerly asks if they seemed to be getting along. Rhaenys says they get along as well as can be expected, but Corlys insists that Rhaenyra has grown only more lovely these past few years and Laenor will soon be smitten with her. Rhaenys then bluntly tells her husband that they both know their son's ""nature"". Embarrassed, Corlys waves it off, insisting that Laenor is just young and will ""grow out of it"". Rhaenys is instead worried that they have forced Laenor into a dangerous marriage alliance, particularly if the lords of Westeros violently oppose Rhaenyra ascending to the Iron Throne, but Corlys embraces his wife and says this is their chance to set things to rights; that the lords of the realm wronged her and their children by rejecting her as queen as the Great Council, but she says she made peace with this a long time ago, as she can't be robbed of something she didn't have in the first place.After Rhaenyra departs, Laenor sits in private among the beach dunes with Joffrey Lonmouth, revealing that Laenor and Joffrey are actually lovers in a same-sex relationship. Joffrey chides Laenor for still being so worried, as the meeting with Rhaenyra went well beyond their wildest hopes: a bride for Laenor who is fully aware of his relationship with Joffrey who will not only allow it to continue, but isn't even offended, as she intends to have private lovers of her own. Laenor gives him a light shove but the tension breaks and they soon kiss each other passionately.As Viserys's ship heads back across Blackwater Bay to King's Landing, Ser Criston Cole confronts Rhaenyra on the deck. He tells her he knows she doesn't love Laenor and for years she's talked about her fear of being trapped in a loveless arranged marriage. Instead, he pleads with her to flee with him into exile beyond Westeros, where they can be married. Rhaenyra gently insists that she still has duties to her family and to the realm itself, so she can never leave or marry him, but she doesn't consider this a problem because she just worked out an ""understanding"" with Laenor. Criston, however, shifts tone and angrily says that he doesn't just want to be Rhaenyra's ""whore"": he came from nothing and his honor as a Kingsguard is all he has, honor that he forever sullied when he broke his sacred vow of chastity with her. He says that his hope was to restore at least a part of his honor by lawfully marrying her. Rhaenyra begins to explain again that this is impossible, but Criston storms off."
Synopsis,At the Red Keep,"On a rainy day in King's Landing, Ser Otto Hightower prepares to ride out of the Red Keep with his household guards and return to Oldtown, now that he has been replaced as Hand of the King. His daughter Queen Alicent Hightower emotionally pleads with him that she believes Rhaenyra's claim that she is still a virgin, and that his dismissal isn't just due to this but the culmination of pushing too hard for her son Aegon Targaryen to be named the new heir. Otto gravely chides her for her naivety and presents her with the cold logic of the situation: Viserys's health is failing and whenever he eventually dies, Rhaenyra will have to kill Alicent's children whether she wants to or not, simply to ensure her own survival. Alicent therefore has only two choices: either start plotting to secure her position at court against Rhaenyra, or fully commit to ingratiating herself with her stepdaughter and hope that when Rhaenyra takes the throne, this will make her merciful enough towards Alicent that she won't kill her half-siblings. Unable to express in words that he loves her and wants to protect her, Otto gives Alicent a desperate final embrace and then rides out of the castle.Alicent then goes to the castle's godswood for solitude but she encounters Larys Strong, the crippled and soft-spoken younger son of Lord Lyonel Strong. Larys remarks on flowers from Braavos that are maintained in the garden, removed from their native climate, which have nonetheless managed to thrive there (a clear allusion to Alicent herself). He then makes a back-handed inquiry into Rhaenyra's health, so that when Alicent asks what cause he has for such concern, he ""accidentally"" reveals that the same night Daemon was exiled again Rhaenyra was presented with a medicinal tea brewed by Grand Maester Mellos himself. Alicent realizes his unstated implication that Rhaenyra must have received Moon tea, an abortifacient drug, and therefore she must have truly had sex with Daemon.After Criston Cole returns from Driftmark, Alicent then summons him to her chambers and dismisses her servants so they can speak in private. Alicent is hesitant and carefully chooses her words, starting to say that she has heard rumors that Rhaenyra is no longer a virgin, though not specifying who she had sex with. Overcome with guilt and distraught at Rhaenyra's rejection of his marriage offer, Criston confesses that the rumors are true, because he is the one who had sex with Rhaenyra. This surprises her, as she had assumed the culprit was Rhaenyra's uncle Daemon. Criston says that even if Rhaenyra initiated things, it is still his own fault for abandoning his Kingsguard vows. Criston pleads that if Alicent is a merciful queen, he only makes the small request that he be granted a quick death by execution, instead of the gelding and drawn-out torture that by right the king will subject him to. Alicent, however, is utterly stunned at Rhaenyra's betrayal, realizing that she used a lie of exact words to swear on her dead mother's memory that she never had sex with Daemon, but she still wasn't a virgin. While some of the details were inaccurate, Otto was fundamentally correct to suspect Rhaenyra of losing her virginity and jeopardizing the upcoming marriage alliance, thus Rhaenyra indirectly cost Alicent's father his high-ranking position at court. Her heart hardening, Alicent surprises Criston by quietly telling him to go and return to his duties.When King Viserys arrives back at the castle from his journey, however, he collapses as soon as he dismounts from his carriage in the courtyard. Rushed to his private chambers, he recovers slightly in a bathtub while attended by his maesters. Amputating the two fingers on the king's left hand only slowed the advance of the persistent infection, and now after several more years it has once again continued to spread along much of his forearm. Grand Maester Mellos insists on yet another round of leechings, but his new young aide Maester Orwyle instead suggests that a new mixture of medicines in a poultice might be more effective. The conservative old maester scoffs at this and says his leechings have always improved the king's condition, though the elderly Mellos then struggles to stand back up (hinting that his time as Grand Maester may be coming to an end before much longer). After he leaves, Orwyle hands Lord Lyonel a new medicine anyway and says that drinking it will help the king sleep. Now alone, Viserys laments to Lyonel that he doesn't think he'll be much remembered as king, because he wasn't a great warrior and made no glorious conquests, but neither did he suffer any major defeats. Lyonel says that many would consider that a good legacy. Pained, Viserys smiles but says that a peaceful and uneventful reign isn't the stuff of epic songs retold at feasts. He then ponders wistfully, that if some great crisis had occurred when he was younger, it's possible he might have risen to the occasion and in that crucible been forged into a different, better man. Rather than humour him, Lyonel says many yearn for that test but in truth most men faced with crisis wish it hadn't come to them. Viserys respects his honesty, but can't help but think of another life he may have had and wonder about his legacy."
Synopsis,The royal wedding,"The long-awaited royal wedding ceremonies finally begin: first a grand feast in the Red Keep, to be followed by seven days of tournaments and spectacle, culminating with the marriage ceremony. The Velaryons arrive on their dragons: Laenor on Seasmoke, and his mother Rhaenys on the older and larger Meleys. Meanwhile, Corlys and the full Velaryon fleet arrive in the harbour, as the city's bells toll out to greet them for the festivities.The feast is held in the throne room itself. Envoys from all the major noble houses of the realm are announced in turn by Ser Harrold Westerling as they enter, such as Lord Jason Lannister and Lord Hobert Hightower (with the notable absence of Otto). Viserys and Rhaenyra sit at the middle of the high table set up in front of the throne's base and receive each in group, though Queen Alicent is noticeably late and has yet to arrive. The entire room comes to a halt for the entrance of the stunning entourage of House Velaryon, dressed in extravagant gold tracery. Corlys, Rhaenys, Laenor, and Ser Vaemond take their seat at one side of the high table. The assembled guests are surprised, however, when just after the Velaryon entourage finishes coming through the doors, Daemon Targaryen follows some distance behind them, even though his brother Viserys exiled him for a second time and told him never to return. As Daemon was Corlys's partner in the capture of the Stepstones, however, they are the only faction at court where he is somewhat welcome. After a tense moment, Viserys silently welcomes his brother back, as it seems Daemon is appearing out of courtesy for his niece's wedding. Viserys orders another chair brought up to the high table for Daemon, next to Lyonel Strong at the opposite side from the Velaryons. After the moment with Daemon has passed, Viserys rises to give a speech in praise of House Velaryon as the crown's most faithful and powerful allies, and that this marriage will unite both families as one.Just then, Queen Alicent enters through the main doors, intentionally interrupting the king in the middle of his speech. Alicent is dressed in a green dress. Larys notes to his brother Ser Harwin Strong that when House Hightower calls its bannermen to assemble for war, the watch fire in the Hightower is set to burn a green color: in effect, green is the Hightowers' war color. Alicent silently makes her way through the feast hall as all, save for Daemon, rise for her presence. When she reaches the high table she gives Viserys a curt peck on the cheek. Alicent coldly congratulates Rhaenyra, referring to her only as ""stepdaughter"". Her fixed, sharp glares and dramatic entrance make it clear to Rhaenyra that she knows she was lied to, and their friendship is over. Viserys returns to his speech, concluding with his hope that just as the Velaryons have followed the Targaryens since the age of dragons in Valyria, this new union will usher in a second age of dragons in Westeros.Despite the tense entrances of Daemon and then Alicent, they are behaving civil in public, so the tension subsides and the wedding feast begins in earnest. Musicians begin to play as Rhaenyra and Laenor begin the first dance of the evening, and they are then joined by dozens of other couples in a large-scale ballroom dance. Alicent leaves the high table and approaches her uncle Hobert, who affirms Oldtown's support of Alicent. Ser Gerold Royce then approaches the high table to openly accuse that Daemon killed his cousin Rhea Royce, as her riding skill is so well known she couldn't possibly have died in an accident. Daemon warns him that such accusations are not only serious but have little evidence, but he will have time to hear them out again when Daemon goes to the Eyrie to present Lady Jeyne Arryn with his claims over his dead wife's inheritance to Runestone. Gerold leaves, and from across the table Daemon exchanges glances with Corlys's daughter Laena (now an attractive young maiden of 17 years). When Laena goes to the dance floor Daemon cuts in to pair with her, and they exchange light flirtations.Meanwhile, from observing how Rhaenyra and Criston keep glancing at each other, Joffrey Lonmouth accurately deduces that Criston is her secret lover, and notes this to Laenor. Lonmouth then makes his way over to Criston and speaks of their informal alliance, and how both of them will protect the secrets of Rhaenyra and Laenor. Lonmouth has no way of knowing that Criston desperately wanted to marry Rhaenyra to restore his honor, and is on the verge of a complete breakdown. Daemon then cuts in to dance with Rhaenyra, and they speak in High Valyrian to keep their conversation private from those around them. Daemon urges Rhaenyra that she hasn't married Laenor yet, and though he thinks he's a good man and brave knight, he will ""bore"" Rhaenyra in their sham marriage, so she has this one last chance to run away with Daemon now that his wife is dead. Rhaenyra, however, feels spurned by Daemon and suspects that he only wants to marry her to gain political power for himself. As they exchange fiery words, they come close to kissing. Viserys angrily observes Daemon through the crowd, but just then they are interrupted by a piercing cry from a different part of the feast floor.A brawl has broken out in the packed room, but it becomes clear that at the center of it Criston Cole has begun pummeling Joffrey Lonmouth. Laenor manages to struggle his way through to them and tackles Criston off Lonmouth, but Criston rises and punches out the groom. As waves of scuffles ripple out it nearly turns into a human crush. Another angry guest throws Laenor over a table and away from Criston. Rhaenyra is nearly trampled but Lyonel sends his son Harwin to save her: Harwin tosses and punches people in the crowd aside to reach Rhaenyra, then slings her over his shoulder and wades out to safety. Criston kneels on Lonmouth's chest and continues his savage beating. Lonmouth manages to pull out his dagger, but Criston easily blocks it and snaps his arm. Criston then flies into a dark fury, shouting and punching Lonmouth over and over again, the onlookers too stunned and afraid to intervene. Criston keeps punching until his arm is so tired he cannot lift it anymore, revealing that he has beaten Lonmouth's face in with his bare hands and killed him. The left side of Lonmouth's face is cracked open down to the skull, trailing viscera onto the floor. Criston silently rises and slowly walks out of the throne room, the other guards too terrified to stop him. As the guests clear the floor, Laenor regains consciousness nearby and rushes over to his lover, only to see that his face has been reduced to gore. Laenor wails in anguish while cradling his body. The stress is too much for Viserys's already delicate health, and he begins to bleed copiously from his nose.Unobserved, Criston makes his way to the godswood, and slowly removes his white cloak and armor, now stained in Lonmouth's blood. Criston kneels in front of the sacred weirwood heart tree, and calmly and deliberately draws his dagger, preparing to kill himself. At the last moment Alicent appears and calls his name, preventing his suicide. Rhaenyra has ended this day with two major enemies bitterly opposed to her.Some hours later, all of the guests have been ordered out and King Viserys has cancelled the seven days of festivities and games leading to the wedding ceremony. Instead, determined to finish this as quickly as possible, Viserys has called in the High Septon to wed Rhaenyra and Laenor in a private exchange of vows in front of their respective parents and close advisors. Rhaenyra and Laenor are still in shock and crying, as they go through the rote exchange of vows on their now ruined wedding day. The High Septon concludes and pronounces them officially married: at this release Viserys, who had been holding himself together on pure adrenaline, drops to the floor in a full faint. His aides rush to tend to him, while on the other side of the throne room, rats lick at the pools of Lonmouth's still warm blood."
