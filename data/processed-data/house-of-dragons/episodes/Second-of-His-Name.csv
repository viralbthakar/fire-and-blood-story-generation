Synopsis,In the Crownlands,"Three years have passed since King Viserys's marriage to Alicent Hightower, in which time Queen Alicent has given birth to a son, Prince Aegon. The royal court is preparing to depart for a grand hunt in the Kingswood, with Viserys excited to leave the politics of court behind even as his new Master of Ships, Ser Tyland Lannister, badgers him about the prospect of Prince Daemon and Lord Corlys being defeated in the Stepstones. Ser Otto Hightower dismisses Tyland's concerns, insisting that Daemon and Corlys's military campaign was commenced without the king's blessing and that to send aid to them now would make the Crown look weak, while Viserys is more concerned about the notable absence of his daughter. Alicent finds Princess Rhaenyra brooding in the Red Keep's godswood; Alicent tries to make friendly overtures to her old friend turned stepdaughter, but Rhaenyra is disinclined to listen and storms out. In private, Otto's elder brother, Lord Hobert Hightower, urges his brother to encourage Viserys, now that Aegon's infancy is over, to name the boy as heir apparent to the Iron Throne, in keeping with Westerosi tradition.The royal family travels to the Kingswood in a closed wheelhouse; Rhaenyra expresses surprise the heavily pregnant Alicent is accompanying them, though she replies that the maester assured her being out in the fresh air will do her good. Rhaenyra is left discomforted when Viserys expresses hope she will soon marry and make him a grandfather. The mood grows further tense when Viserys insists she should accompany him on the hunt in her capacity as his heir, as he claims she has been shirking her duties as princess; Rhaenyra scoffs at the idea, insisting that none of the nobles present at this hunt are here for her, a conclusion that is only strengthened upon their arrival at the royal hunting encampment, where Lord Hobert leads the cheering for the infant Aegon, hailing the boy as the ""Second of His Name"", making it clear to Rhaenyra at least some of the realm's nobility consider Aegon, not her, Viserys's heir.Within the royal pavilion, after enduring the conversations of the noble ladies present and growing angry at their denigration of Daemon's campaign in the Stepstones, Rhaenyra exits the pavilion only to be approached by Lord Jason Lannister, who plies her with honeyed wine made in Lannisport and waxes lyrical about the privileges offered by Casterly Rock. Rhaenyra is confused when Lord Jason admits he does not possess a Dragonpit but does have the means to build one; when Rhaenyra questions why he would need such a thing, Jason replies he would build one to satisfy his Queen...or his lady wife. Realizing that Lord Jason is trying to make a marriage proposal to her, Rhaenyra takes her leave and storms back into the royal pavilion to remonstrate with Viserys.When she confronts her father, Viserys insists Lord Jason's proposal is merely the latest in a long list of offers for her hand he's been receiving since she came of age, and Rhaenyra has snubbed every effort Viserys has made to engage her in the discussion. Rhaenyra protests she has no interest in marriage, to which Viserys angrily rages that he was expected to marry again for tradition and duty, so she is no different. Before the argument gets more vicious, Otto interrupts with a report that a white hart has been sighted by the Royal Huntsman, insisting catching and killing such a creature, hailed in local lore as the ""King of the Kingswood"" would surely be an auspicious portent on Prince Aegon' nameday. Before departing with Otto, Viserys insists Rhaenyra will marry.Furious and hurt, Rhaenyra storms out of the pavilion, mounts a horse and flees the encampment; Ser Criston Cole sees her doing so and mounts up to follow Rhaenyra in his capacity as her sworn shield. Rhaenyra races through the Kingswood with Criston in close pursuit, begging her to stop, before finally catching her on the shores of a small lake. Rhaenyra bitterly laments her father trying to marry her off to Jason Lannister, though she is briefly cheered up when Criston jokingly offers to kill him. Criston urges they return to camp, but Rhaenyra suggests they explore the Kingswood for a while, as she has no desire to return yet. As they walk through the forest, Rhaenyra asks Criston if he was betrothed; he replies that his status as the son of Lord Dondarrion's steward would have allowed him to wed a common girl, but there was never any he had his eye on. Rhaenyra confesses to being envious of his freedom, lamenting that despite being named her father's heir, she wields no real power and authority, being little more than a figurehead. Criston counsels her otherwise, reminding Rhaenyra that she was the one who raised him to the Kingsguard, the highest honor that anyone from House Cole has ever received.Back at the royal pavilion, as Viserys gets drunk and waits for reports from the Royal Huntsman the white hart has been tracked down, Lord Jason Lannister approaches the king and tries to press his suit for Rhaenyra's hand. Unfortunately, his comment that as Lady of Casterly Rock, Rhaenyra will be well compensated for her loss in station as Viserys's heir angers the king at the assumption he intends to replace Rhaenyra as his heir. When Lord Jason admits there has been idle talk amongst some of the lords regarding the suggestion, Viserys angrily accuses Jason of allowing treasonous talk to foment amongst his bannermen and dismisses him. Viserys is further exasperated when Otto approaches him, suggesting an alternative betrothal for Rhaenyra: Prince Aegon (in a transparent attempt to move his grandson closer to the Iron Throne). Viserys laughs incredulously at the notion, insisting the boy is only two years old. Otto suggests it would put an end to further suits from the nobility for Rhaenyra's hand and the bother this has caused Viserys, but Viserys dismisses the matter out of hand, along with Otto, and sinks deeper into his cups.Later in the evening, he engages his Master of Laws, Lord Lyonel Strong in conversation, lamenting that despite being Lord of the Seven Kingdoms, he is unable to control his seventeen year old daughter. Lord Lyonel jokingly suggests it might be a Targaryen family tradition, given that while Viserys's grandfather, King Jaehaerys I Targaryen, ruled over half a century of peace, he was driven near to madness by the antics of his children, particularly his daughters, eliciting some amusement from Viserys. Lyonel asks if the King wishes his advice on the matter; Viserys irritably assumes Lyonel means to put forward his own son Ser Harwin Strong as a candidate for Rhaenyra's hand, but Lyonel instead advocates the best choice for Rhaenyra might be a marriage to Ser Laenor Velaryon; as the Sea Snake's son, he is heir to the wealthiest House in Westeros, of pure Valyrian descent with Targaryen blood from his mother, Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, and such a marriage would help heal the rift between Houses Targaryen and Velaryon, only made worse by Viserys spurning Laenor's sister, Laena Velaryon in favor of Alicent. Though Lyonel does note the proposal depends on Laenor surviving his father's campaign in the Stepstones, Viserys clearly gives the matter considered thought.Out in the Kingswood, Rhaenyra and Criston make camp for the night. Rhaenyra asks Criston if he believes the realm will accept her as Queen; Criston demurs and insists they will have no choice but to. A rustling in the foliage nearby disturbs them; when Criston draws his sword and goes to investigate, a wild boar charges out of the bushes, trampling Criston and attacking Rhaenyra before Criston and Rhaenyra overpower and kill the animal, Rhaenyra delivering the killing blow in a wrathful frenzy. Back at the royal encampment, a heavily drunk Viserys laments to Alicent his fears he made a mistake naming Rhaenyra his heir; his obsessive pursuit of the prophetic vision he had, of a son born to him wearing Aegon the Conqueror's crown, resulted in Viserys losing Queen Aemma and becoming estranged from Rhaenyra. He'd hoped naming Rhaenyra as his heir might begin to repair the damage his obsession caused, both to his family and to the realm, but despite Alicent's reassurances, a tearful Viserys wonders, now he has a son born to him, was he wrong to put Rhaenyra first.The next morning, Viserys and his courtiers accompany the Royal Huntsman to a clearing in the godswood; unable to track down the white hart, they have caught a large stag for Viserys to kill instead. Using a spear borrowed from Lord Jason, it takes a conflicted Viserys two strikes to slay the animal. Elsewhere in the kingswood, a dishevelled and bloodstained Rhaenyra and Criston encounter the white hart; Rhaenyra merely admires the animal before letting it go unharmed and returning to the royal encampment with the boar's carcass.Back at the Red Keep, Otto and Alicent share a private conversation: Otto insists Alicent urge Viserys to name Aegon as his heir, claiming letting Rhaenyra pass over him to ascend the Iron Throne would incite chaos. Alicent reminds her father that the nobility of the realm, including House Hightower, swore obeisance to Rhaenyra as Viserys' heir and that she will not raise her son to steal his sister's birthright. Otto retorts that Aegon is the one being robbed, as by tradition and precedent, as Viserys' son, he is his father's rightful heir, and the next King of Westeros. Later that evening, Alicent goes to speak with Viserys, who reveals he has received a petition from Ser Vaemond Velaryon, requesting reinforcements in the Stepstones, as well as frustratedly insisting that Rhaenyra needs a husband of suitable rank to support her and rule by her side as King-Consort, regardless of her personal feelings on the matter. Alicent urges Viserys to give Rhaenyra at least the belief she can choose her own husband, as well as sending reinforcements to the Stepstones, since it is better for Westeros that the Velaryons and Daemon, rather than the Crabfeeder, are victorious.The next morning, Viserys summons Rhaenyra to the Small Council chamber. He reveals his intention to send reinforcements to Daemon; Viserys refuses to let his younger brother die out of pride. He asks Rhaenyra's thoughts on the matter, to which she retorts he and his Small Council have made it frequently clear her thoughts on matters of governance are immaterial, prompting Viserys to exasperatedly ask if his daughter intends to become as much a thorn in his side as his brother. He apologizes for trying to foist Jason Lannister on her, insisting that he only wanted to help Rhaenyra by providing her House Lannister's wealth and power through marriage; Rhaenyra scoffs that in her mind, it was her father making a pretty transparent effort to get her out of the way so he could replace her. Viserys insists he is not trying to replace Rhaenyra, but reminds her, even though his marriage to her mother became a happy one, it was originally arranged for political gain, as have most royal marriages in Westerosi history. Viserys urges Rhaenyra to pick a husband, both so she can have the happiness of starting a family of her own and build support for her claim to the Iron Throne with her husband's family, but insists he will allow her to choose her own consort."
Synopsis,In the Stepstones,"It has been three years since Lord Corlys Velaryon and Prince Daemon Targaryen led an invasion fleet to the Stepstones to put an end to the depredations of Craghas Drahar. On the beach of Bloodstone, as Drahar amuses himself by executing prisoners while his men loot the wreckage of a Velaryon ship, Daemon descends atop Caraxes, the dragon's fire incinerating many of the Triarchy's soldiers on the beach, while the rest retreat with Drahar into the island's caverns where Caraxes cannot pursue. Volleys of arrows from Triarchy archers on the cliffs overlooking the beach force Daemon and Caraxes to retreat.Several weeks later, at the Velaryon camp on Dwarfstone, Corlys, along with his son Laenor and brother Vaemond discuss their situation as Daemon returns from another dragonborne sortie against Drahar's stronghold. Corlys lists that their supplies are about to run out, the men are demoralized, and ships bound to resupply them from Driftmark are still weeks away. Laenor proposes a desperate gambit, using Daemon as bait to lure the Crabfeeder's forces into the open to eliminate them all at once, despite his uncle's misgivings. The war council is interrupted by the arrival of Ser Addam, a messenger from King's Landing sent by Viserys, promising his brother reinforcements. Furious at the notion of being bailed out by his older brother, Daemon furiously attacks the messenger, beating him with his helmet before the Velaryons intervene. Daemon later departs for Bloodstone alone in a rowing boat.Fashioning a white flag from the wreckage of previous battles on Bloodstone, Daemon goes to one knee, holding out Dark Sister in a gesture of surrender. When one of Drahar's soldiers moves to take the sword, Daemon stabs him with a dagger, recovers Dark Sister, and cuts down any man standing between himself and Drahar. The Triarchy archers bring Daemon down short of his goal, but as Triarchy soldiers move in to finish him off, they are set ablaze by Laenor Velaryon astride his own dragon Seasmoke, who then wipes out the Triarchy archers overlooking the battlefield. As the Triarchy forces reel, Corlys and Vaemond lead a brutal counterattack against the enemy, while Daemon pursues Drahar into the caves. As the Velaryon forces claim victory, a blood-stained Daemon emerges, dragging the upper half of Drahar's bisected corpse behind him."
