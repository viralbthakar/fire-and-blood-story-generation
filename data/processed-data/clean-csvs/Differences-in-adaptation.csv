General differences,Characters' physical appearances,"*As with Game of Thrones, many of the younger cast members had to be aged-up for legal as well as pragmatic reasons: i.e. in the book, Aegon II marries when he is 13 years old, but it would be explicitly illegal for a TV series filmed in the United Kingdom to depict someone younger than 16 marrying.*King Viserys I Targaryen was severely obese late in his reign: he isn't in the promo images that have been released so far, though all of these have been from the early part of his reign. Viserys had a bushy, silver-gold mustache, and cropped his hair short, while TV-Viserys wears his hair long to his shoulders.*Rhaenyra Targaryen was very beautiful in her youth, but six pregnancies ruined her figure, so that she was stout by the time she was an adult. In the TV series, adult Rhaenyra doesn't look stout. This same issue actually came up in Game of Thrones: in the books, Lysa Tully is said to be very stout after many pregnancies (all of which ended in miscarriages and stillbirths, except for one), but they didn't cast a stout actress for the live-action role.*Valyrians typically have eye colors ranging from purple to deep blue - as with Game of Thrones, this detail has been dropped.*Rhaenys Targaryen had her father Aemon's purple eyes, and her mother Jocelyn Baratheon's black hair. Her hair later gained white streaks as she aged. Prior to the publishing of Fire & Blood, her hair was simply stated to be silver, but this is now non-canon.*Although Corlys Velaryon's physical appearance is never described, the Velaryons are not known to have been black or otherwise of a dark skin tone. House Velaryon overall is described in A Feast for Crows as having typical Valyrian features such as silver hair, purple eyes, and pale skin. Aurane Waters, a bastard of House Velaryon, is considered by Cersei to resemble Rhaegar Targaryen, though he has grey-green eyes rather than purple. It is somewhat implied that lower-ranking Valyrian families weren't as strict about blood purity, but the Velaryons aren't described as one of them.*Mysaria had skin pale as milk. While she is said to be a slave from Lys, and slave populations are racially mixed, she is not described as being of partial Yi Tish (East Asian) descent. *Ser Criston Cole is not known to have been of Dornish descent - though House Cole are the stewards of Blackhaven, which is in the borderlands with Dorne. He is also not described as ""lowborn"" (the Coles are minor nobles who serve as hereditary stewards, but they are still considered nobles). He is described as having coal black hair and pale green eyes.*For most of his life, old age included, Jaehaerys I Targaryen kept his beard so long it reached his waist.",* As Game Thrones many younger cast members aged-up legal well pragmatic reasons : i.e . book Aegon II marries 13 years old would explicitly illegal TV series filmed United Kingdom depict someone younger 16 marrying . * King Viserys I Targaryen severely obese late reign : n't promo images released far though early part reign .

He may have been given a larger role in the TV series, replacing Criston Cole in some parts of the story.*There is no mention of characters named Mickon, Marlow, and Randyll Barret in Fire & Blood.*The Iron Throne is much larger in the books than in the Game of Thrones TV series, said to be a massive and ugly pile of melted swords nearly forty feet tall. The depiction of the throne in House of the Dragon is actually closer to its book description, while still trying to make it look like it's plausibly the same throne room as in the first TV series (by adding many swords sprawling along the floor away from the main chair).*The Heir's Tournament in King's Landing is based on a different tourney from Fire & Blood, taking place at Maidenpool.*The dragon in the coat-of-arms of House Targaryen is not described with four legs. Since dragons are known to have two legs, it is assumed that the heraldic dragon also has two legs as it is not described otherwise. Another difference is that the heraldic dragon in the books is breathing flames.*The coat-of-arms of House Velaryon displays an actual, real-life seahorse, not a mythological one (spelled as sea-horse with a hyphen). The mythological half-horse/half-fish design is from real-life heraldry databases.*The coat-of-arms of House Stark displays a full direwolf, not just its head. This is a difference carried over from Game of Thrones.*Daemon Targaryen is not known to have used his own coat-of-arms.*According to Fire & Blood, Viserys's son Baelon lived for one day after his mother's death, not a few hours.*The history of the Valyrian steel dagger used by the catspaw assassin (and Arya Stark in Game of Thrones) was never detailed. There are only about 200 surviving Valyrian steel blades in Westeros so it's not implausible that it belonged to the Targaryens at some point.*Daemon nastily wrote about men from the Vale and sheep in a letter; he did not announce that in a meeting of the small council.*Otto Hightower did not speak against Daemon and compare him to Maegor Targaryen in a meeting of the small council; he wrote that to his brother Lord Hightower.",* King Jaehaerys present Great Council growing weak body mind old age . * The two popular contenders Great Council Viserys Targaryen Laenor Velaryon Viserys Rhaenys Targaryen . * Ser Harrold Westerling sworn shield Rhaenyra Targaryen .

Mysaria would apparently miscarry the child when the ship carrying her hit a storm, resulting in another brief rift between Viserys and Daemon.*In Fire & Blood, Viserys's intention to marry Alicent didn't raise much consternation with the small council or Rhaenyra, as at the time he was 25 and she was 18, while Rhaenyra was only 9 years old when her father remarried. The biggest opponents to Viserys's remarriage were Corlys and Daemon.*In Fire & Blood, there is no mention that Craghas Drahar sank any of Corlys's ships. The reason for fighting Drahar was that he and his partners used to charge outrageous tolls for safe passage.*In Fire & Blood, there is no mention that Corlys demanded that the Crown would take action against Craghas, and that Viserys refused.
