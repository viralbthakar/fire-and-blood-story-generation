Biography,House of the Dragon: Season 1,"Criston competes in the Heir's Tournament. In his first joust he defeats a knight of House Tarly. He then defeats Lord Boremund and another Baratheon. Criston next faces Prince Daemon Targaryen after several evenly matched tilts, Daemon is unhorsed by him, with Daemon then demanding a contest of arms on foot. Criston readies his flail as the prince draws his sword Dark Sister. In fierce combat, Criston breaks apart Daemon's shield, with Daemon swinging at his breastplate in return. With the prince eventually kicking Criston to the ground and as Daemon gloats, Criston rises to his feet and knocks him to the ground and forces the prince to yield. After his victory, Criston asks for the favor of Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen, who obliges throwing her laurel wreath down to him and wishes him luck.Six months after the tourney Ser Criston is named to the Kingsguard, at the insistence of Princess Rhaenyra, as he is the only candidate who has real combat experience. He later travels to Dragonstone with a detachment of men led by Ser Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King, to force Prince Daemon to give up his occupation of the castle. When Daemon ""accidentally"" calls him ""Ser Crispin"", Criston retorts by reminding Daemon of how he defeated him at the Heir's Tournament. The situations escalates, and both sides draw their swords, but Princess Rhaenyra arrives and manages to convince Daemon to return the dragon egg without bloodshed.Three years later, King Viserys organizes a royal hunt in the Kingswood, in honor of his son Aegon's second nameday. Before departure, the king approaches Ser Criston, asking after the whereabouts of Rhaenyra, but Criston confesses he doesn't know where she is.Later, at the camp in the Kingswood, Criston sees Rhaenyra storm out of the tent and ride off on her horse. He swiftly mounts his own horse and chases after her. He manages to catch her, and she tells him that her father was trying to marry her off to Lord Jason Lannister. Criston jokingly asks if she wants him to kill Jason, which seems to amuse Rhaenyra. He tells her they should return to camp, but she suggests they take in the Kingswood. As they walk, Rhaenyra asks him if he was ever betrothed, to which he confesses that his station was never high enough for a formal betrothal, though he could have married a common-born girl had he wished. Rhaenyra tells him he's lucky to have a say in his own life, as despite being the princess, she feels she has no real power. Criston reminds her that it was only because of her that he became a Kingsguard - the highest honor any member of his house has ever known.That night, as he and Rhaenyra sit by a fire, Criston requests once again, that they return to camp, as her father will be worried, but she is still unwilling. Rhaenyra asks him if he thinks the people will ever truly accept her as their ruler, to which he replies that they will have no choice but to. At that moment, there is a rustling in the nearby bushes. Criston pulls out his sword, preparing to defend his princess from danger. After a tense silence, a boar charges out of the bushes, knocking Criston over, and attacking Rhaenyra. Criston recovers, and runs the boar through with his sword, saving his princess, who finishes the beast off by stabbing it multiple times in rage.As the two of them head back to camp with their kill, they are approached by another animal: A white hart. Criston slowly draws his sword, but Rhaenyra softly tells him not to. He obeys, and the stag turns and runs off. When they return to camp with the dead boar, they are greeted by incredulous stares from everyone gathered.Some time later, Ser Criston accompanies Princess Rhaenyra on a tour to find potential suitors for her hand. During an audience at Storm's End. Rhaenyra dismisses every suitor that approaches, and when a fight breaks out between Willem Blackwood and Jerrel Bracken, she tells Criston that they're leaving, and orders him to have their ship prepared to return to King's Landing, even though the tour was supposed to continue on to Bitterbridge. As they are leaving, they hear a yell, and turn to see that Willem has run Jerrel through with his sword. Criston tells Rhaenyra to look away.As they sail back to King's Landing, Rhaenyra asks Criston if she thinks her father will be angry, to which Criston sarcastically asks whether she refers to her refusal of all the suitors or her ending the tour early. Just then, they hear a dragon's cry overhead. Criston orders everyone to take cover, before Caraxes swoops down, brushing their ship, and dangerously rocking it. Criston immediately checks on the princess, and calls for the maesters, but Rhaenyra insists she's fine.That night, Criston bids Rhaenyra goodnight and stands guard outside her bedroom door. Several hours later, much to his bewilderment, Rhaenyra (who, unbeknownst to him, had slipped out of her room through a secret passage and joined Daemon for a night on the town) enters her bedroom again, now dressed as a commoner. As he checks to make sure she's all right, Rhaenyra, sexually charged from her exploits with Daemon, playfully grabs his helmet from him and holds it out of reach, despite his impatient requests that she return it. Eventually, she holds it out to him, and kisses him when he moves to take it, stunning him. Ignoring his halfhearted protests, Rhaenyra begins to slowly strip Criston of his armor. Criston hesitates, looking meaningfully at his white cloak as he takes it off, torn between his vow of chastity and his desire for (and reluctance to disobey) his princess. Eventually, he gives into temptation and starts kissing her back, and they share a night of ecstasy.The next morning, Criston, visibly uncomfortable after the previous night's encounter, enters Rhaenyra's chambers to give her a summons from Queen Alicent Hightower.That evening, Criston and several other members of the Kingsguard, escort Rhaenyra to her father's chambers. Criston is visibly nervous as he opens the door for her.Criston accompanies Rhaenyra, Viserys, and the new King's Hand, Lord Lyonel Strong, to Driftmark, to propose a marriage to Lord Corlys Velaryon between Rhaenyra and his son Ser Laenor Velaryon. On the way back, Criston, still guilt-ridden over breaking his Kingsguard vow, approaches Rhaenyra, and asks her to run away with him to Essos, where she could marry him - a marriage for love, not duty. As Rhaenyra has often talked about how much she hates her position, Criston believes this would benefit both of them: She would get to do as she wishes, and he could escape the shame of breaking his vow. After a few seconds of silence, however, Rhaenyra refuses, saying that she doesn't want to live in infamy, and must do her duty, no matter how much she may hate it. She does, however, inform him that she and Laenor have come to an understanding: After they perform their royal duty, they each pursue their own desires. Criston, distraught and angry, accuses her of wanting to make him his whore. He gave up his honor and soiled his white cloak - the only thing he has to his name - for Rhaenyra, and with her refusal, he now sees no way of restoring it.Upon returning to King's Landing, Criston is summoned by Queen Alicent, who questions him about a rumor she heard that Rhaenyra had been involved in a ""breach of morals"". Unbeknownst to him, the rumor she refers to is that Rhaenyra had sex with her uncle Daemon, but Criston believes that she has learned about his own sexual encounter with Rhaenyra. Seeing one last chance to restore his honor in death, Criston confesses his sin, only asking for a merciful death. Alicent, however, merely thanks him for his honesty and dismisses him.Throughout the welcoming feast for Rhaenyra and Laenor's marriage, Criston stands by, watching them dance together, visibly on edge. He is approached by Ser Joffrey Lonmouth, who subtly admits to being Laenor's paramour, and hints that he knows Criston's secret. Joffrey tells Criston that they should swear to guard the two of them and their secrets for the sake of them all. This perceived threat pushes Criston over the edge, and he starts pummeling Joffrey, to the shock and horror of everyone gathered. When Laenor tries to pull him off, Criston punches him before proceeding to beat Joffrey to death, caving in the entire left side of his face. After staring down at his victim for a few seconds, Criston silently rises and walks out, everyone too terrified to stop him.Criston walks out to the godswood, removing his white cloak and his sword, and with his honor now beyond repair and nothing else to live for, prepares to take his own life with his dagger. However, his suicide attempt is interrupted by Queen Alicent who calls out to him.A decade later, Criston is now a firm ally of Queen Alicent in return for her saving him at his lowest. While operating as a master-at-arms for Rhaenyra and Alicent's sons, Criston intentionally allows Aegon, Alicent's eldest son, to roughhouse Jacaerys Velaryon, Rhaenyra's eldest son. When Harwin Strong intervenes, Criston alludes to the rumor that Jacaerys and his brothers Lucerys and Joffrey are Harwin's bastard sons, which provokes Harwin to start beating him. The fallout over this leads Harwin to leave King's Landing.At the funeral of Laena Velaryon, Criston notices Lord Larys Strong staring at Alicent. While Alicent assures him that it is simply Larys's pride at becoming the new Lord of Harrenhal, Criston remains suspicious. He is later given the night's watch by Lord Commander Harrold Westerling.Criston is among the Kingsguard who separate Rhaenyra and Daemon's children from Prince Aemond, who has lost an eye in the fight. Everyone is summoned to the Hall of Nine by the king, who berates the Kingsguard for failing to prevent the fight. Criston tries to shift blame onto Jace, Luke, Baela, and Rhaena, but Viserys silences him. Alicent later orders Criston to take one of Luke's eyes as revenge, but he stays put. When she tries to do it herself, Criston follows her, but he is held back by Daemon.Six years following these events, Criston has tutored Aemond into becoming a skilled warrior. The prince bests him in a sparring match, to which Criston says he will be winning tournaments in no time.After the death of King Viserys, Criston attends the subsequent meeting of the Small Council. He moves behind Lord Lyman Beesbury when he protests the accession of Prince Aegon to the throne, and accidentally kills him in an attempt to seat him, puncturing his skull against his council totem. Ser Harrold then orders Criston to drop his sword and cloak, but Criston draws his sword, saying he will not suffer insults to the queen. Alicent orders him to sheath his sword, saying no insult was done. Shortly afterwards, Harrold resigns his post when he is ordered to go to Dragonstone and murder Rhaenyra's family, to the smug satisfaction of Criston.Later in the day, Criston is secretly ordered by Alicent to go into King's Landing, find Aegon, and bring him to her. Criston takes Aemond with him. They do not find him in the Street of Silk, which Aemond knows Aegon frequents. Afterwards, Aemond vents about how he should be king due to him putting in effort and doing his duty, to which Criston relates by saying that he has also had to toil for what others are freely given.The two happen to pick up the trail of Arryk and Erryk Cargyll, who have been secretly sent by Otto Hightower for the same purpose. They follow the two to the Grand Sept, where they find Aegon asleep underneath a shrine table. Criston stops Arryk from leaving with Aegon, and the two fight while Aemond grabs Aegon. Criston defeats Arryk, and then tells Aegon that ""the queen awaits.""Before Aegon's coronation, Criston is appointed Lord Commander of the Kingsguard by Alicent for his loyalty.In the Dragonpit, Criston crowns Aegon with the Conqueror's own crown, and hails him as the true heir to the Iron Throne. The coronation is interrupted when Rhaenys Targaryen bursts through the floor on her dragon Meleys. Alicent orders Criston to take Queen Helaena to safety, but Meleys only roars at them before she and Rhaenys fly away to warn Rhaenyra.",Criston competes Heir 's Tournament .
