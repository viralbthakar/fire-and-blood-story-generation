Biography,Background,"Daemon is the grandson of Jaehaerys I Targaryen, younger brother of King Viserys, and  to the Iron Throne. Ser Otto Hightower, the Hand of the King, considers Daemon the greatest threat to the realm.House of the Dragon | Official Website for the HBO Series | HBO.com He is the rider of the dragon Caraxes, an older dragon known as the Blood Wyrm. An experienced and skilled fighter, he wields Dark Sister, the Valyrian steel sword of his grandfather's great aunt Visenya Targaryen. Unlike his older brother, Daemon is - despite his great cunning - an unpredictable and impulsive rogue.At the Great Council of 101 AC, Viserys was chosen by the lords of Westeros as the successor to King Jaehaerys, whose health had begun to fail and who had lost both his sons. During the first nine years of his brother's reign, Daemon served on the Small Council, both as Master of Laws and later as Master of Coin. However, he was removed from those offices, both times at the insistence of Otto Hightower. The rivalry between Daemon and Otto continued, as the Hand saw the prince as a threat if he were to ever become king, possibly a second Maegor the Cruel. Daemon in turn saw Otto as a dishonorable leech who wanted to rise as high as he could get, since his status as a second son would not allow him to inherit anything of his own. Most of the council sided with Otto in this conflict, but Daemon was always defended by his brother.At some point King Viserys arranged a marriage for his younger brother, wedding him to Rhea Royce, the Lady of Runestone. Neither party was happy with this match, with Daemon disparagingly referring to his wife as his ""bronze bitch"".Daemon's personal coat of arms features the three-headed red dragon of House Targaryen, adorned with golden scales and within a border of golden fire. His helmet, forged from Valyrian steel, is adorned with the head and wings of a dragon.https://www.hbo.com/house-of-the-dragon/character-guide#daemon-targaryen",Daemon grandson Jaehaerys I Targaryen younger brother King Viserys Iron Throne .

Biography,House of the Dragon: Season 1,"Daemon returns to King's Landing following a journey and his niece Rhaenyra greets him in the Red Keep's throne room while he is sitting on the Iron Throne. As a gift from his travels, he presents her with a necklace made of Valyrian steel and fastens it upon her. With Daemon wielding the Valyrian steel sword Dark Sister, he claims that they now both own a small piece of their heritage.That night, he leads the City Watch of King's Landing in a ruthless show of force, gathering the city's criminals and administering brutal summary justice; Daemon himself personally beheads an accused murderer with Dark Sister. In a Small Council meeting the next day, Daemon is accosted by Otto for the mass violence he has inflicted, to which Daemon defends his actions as necessary measures to ensure safety to the nobility arriving for Viserys's tournament. Otto then insinuates that he could perhaps show the same dedication he showed to the City Watch towards his wife, leading Daemon to insult both his own and Otto's late wife in retaliation. Before the argument can escalate further, Viserys defuses the tension, while reminding Daemon that another similar show of force will not be tolerated.While making love to his mistress Mysaria, Daemon grows frustrated at the treatment he is being given by Viserys and the members of the Small Council. Mysaria soothes his irritation and reminds him that given his power and reputation, Viserys cannot easily replace him.During the Heir's Tournament, Daemon competes to represent House Targaryen, where he quickly proves his worth as a skilled fighter, even taking the chance to mock Otto further by defeating his son Gwayne and earning his daughter Alicent's favor. However, he is defeated in a joust by Ser Criston of the minor House Cole. Enraged, he demands his squire deliver Dark Sister to him to continues the battle in a duel. Though he initially gains the upper hand, Criston defeats Daemon when he turns his back on him, leading Daemon to storm off.When Queen Aemma dies after in an attempt to save her child Baelon, as well as the child's death shortly after, Daemon is present during their funeral. Though he can plainly see Rhaenyra's anger towards Viserys, Daemon urges her to support him nonetheless, believing he needs her more than ever. In a Small Council meeting later on, Daemon watches the council unseen in the shadows, hearing Otto's insistence that he cannot be heir to the Iron Throne, lest he become a second Maegor the Cruel. Some time later he hosts officers of the City Watch at a brothel, where he raises a toast to his late nephew Baelon.Daemon is later summoned by Viserys to the Great Hall, where his brother questions him on his naming of Baelon as the ""Heir for a Day."" Seeing his brother's anger, Daemon insists that it was his own way of showing grief. When Viserys becomes furious at how he neglected to comfort him and Rhaenyra during their family's tragedy, Daemon retaliates by stating that he had only ever tried to cast him away, such as sending him to the Vale and making him commander of the City Watch, instead of being Hand of the King. Viserys grows angrier at the notion but Daemon believes he should inherently become his Hand as his brother. Viserys says that Otto is a better Hand that he could ever be, leading Daemon to call his brother weak and insult the Small Council as leeches who plainly know it as well. Viserys then disinherits him as his heir and orders to return to the Vale; Daemon tries to approach him but is stopped by the Kingsguard ready to defend Viserys, leading him to walk away in silent fury.As Viserys names Rhaenyra the new heir to the Iron Throne, Daemon is instead at the Dragonpit with Mysaria and his dragon Caraxes. Angered at Viserys denying him his right to the throne, he leaves King's Landing with his mistress atop the Blood Wyrm, making his way to Dragonstone.For half a year, Daemon takes control of Dragonstone, with the City Watch as his personal army. It is also revealed that he has stolen a dragon egg from the Dragonpit, intending to place it in the cradle of the child he has with Mysaria. When Otto is dispatched by Viserys to confront him on Dragonstone, along with several Kingsguard and Otto's own guards, Daemon refuses to back down and draws Dark Sister on the Hand, prompting both sides to unsheathe their weapons. As tensions rise, Caraxes appears from behind to defend his master, forcing Otto to command his guards to sheathe their swords.Daemon is then personally confronted by Rhaenyra, who has defied her father's orders to stay and ridden Syrax to Dragonstone. Knowing he is angry at being denied his place as Viserys' heir, she goads him into killing her in order to get what he desires. Unwilling to harm his niece, Daemon relinquishes the dragon egg to her and walks back to the castle with Mysaria and his men. Inside, she chastises Daemon for lying about their marriage and her supposed pregnancy, as well as relaying her fear that she will be punished for his actions since he is safe as the prince, but she is a common whore.Following Viserys's refusal to marry his daughter and his unwillingness to help with the threat of the Triarchy, Corlys Velaryon approaches Daemon and invites him to Driftmark. Corlys speaks of House Velaryon's ancient history and relations to Old Valyria like House Targaryen, as well as how they are both alike in the sense of them both being seen as lesser than their older brothers. Bored with his discussion about families, Daemon questions him for the true reason he is at Driftmark. The former Master of Ships talks about the looming threat of the Crabfeeder, how he has grown powerful thanks to aid from the Free Cities and how his House could be crippled when the shipping lanes of the Stepstones falls, speaking about Viserys's weakness.Daemon makes it clear that only he is allowed to speak freely about the king, and him alone. Corlys says that if he were to help him with this conflict, he could prove his worth in the eyes of those still seeing him as less than his brother. Hearing Corlys state that their worth is not given but made, Daemon agrees to aid his house with the Crabfeeder.The next three years come as a fruitless struggle for Daemon, Corlys, and their men, as the Crabfeeder, Craghas Drahar, and his Triarchy forces continue to hold the Stepstones in their control. Even Caraxes is not a weapon they could use to turn the conflict in their favor, as the numerous caves of the Stepstones allow Drahar and his men to avoid the dragonfire. News of their rising defeat spread far and wide, leading many to wonder if Viserys should send his own armies to win his brother's seemingly lost war.Even amongst their own forces, trust looms thin: Vaemond Velaryon, brother of Corlys, only sees Daemon as the reason to why they are losing and openly questions why they should serve him, just as the prince arrives at the war council. As Daemon stares quietly at his men, who all wonder who, for their newest plan, will offer themselves as bait at a strategic point on Bloodstone, a messenger from King's Landing appears. Daemon is handed a letter by the young man, and he reads its contents: Viserys plans to send 10 ships and 2,000 men in order to help win the war. He only sees this as his brother bailing him out of his own fight and furiously attacks the messenger with his helmet, needing to be restrained by Vaemond, Joffrey Lonmouth, and Corlys's son Laenor.Using a small rowboat, Daemon rows across from their position to Bloodstone, walks through the war-torn beach, fashions a crude white flag, and waves it in front of the caves. Drahar emerges from his cave and sees him; looking to the sky and seeing no dragon for an ambush, he sends his men out to investigate if they have truly surrendered. Daemon draws Dark Sister and offers it to them on one knee. One soldier takes up the sword and inspects it, only for Daemon to suddenly draw his dagger, cut down the man, and reclaim his weapon. He proceeds to kill all of the approaching soldiers and simultaneously dodges a volley of arrows from above, as he makes his way closer and closer to the edge of the caves, causing Drahar to send out more men.Though he gets close, Daemon is hit by three arrows and forced to halt his charge. Still not seeing a dragon above, Drahar orders the rest of his men to surround Daemon. Before he can be killed by the overwhelming number of soldiers, Laenor arrives and burns away the soldiers with his dragon Seasmoke, saving Daemon and further allowing the Velaryon forces to charge in and cut down the remaining soldiers. As Seasmoke blasts away the cliffside archers and the last of the Triarchy soldiers are locked in battle, Daemon spots Drahar fleeing into his cave and pursues him inside. Moments later, he emerges from the cave, holding the bisected corpse of the Crabfeeder.After the war, Daemon flies back to King's Landing on Caraxes, inadvertently rocking a ship Rhaenyra is on. Once he reaches the throne room, he haughtily makes his way to Viserys, holding Drahar's hammer and wearing a crown. He offers the hammer of his foe to be added to the Iron Throne. Viserys sees his crown and asks if he styles himself king as well, to which Daemon responds that he was named ""King of the Narrow Sea"" following their victory against the Triarchy. Nonetheless, he announces that there is only one true king: his brother. Daemon offers the crown on one knee; Viserys takes it and commands him to rise, before hugging his younger brother, welcoming him back.At a celebration in honor of his return, Daemon playfully argues with Viserys over who was the favorite of their mother, to which Viserys states it has always been Daemon for his rebellious attitude and skill as a warrior. Rhaenyra approaches them and congratulates her uncle on his victory, while Alicent asks if Daemon would like a tour to see new tapestries, causing Viserys and Daemon to laugh uproariously at the silly notion.At the end of the celebration, Daemon meets with Rhaenyra, who asks him the real reason he has returned. Daemon answers that he had returned for the comforts of home, though she remains unsure if he truly finds comfort in King's Landing. Their conversation's attention turns to Rhaenyra's growing ire at her father for trying to force her into marriage. In High Valyrian, they talk about marriage being nothing but a political arrangement, though Rhaenyra notes it is also a death sentence for women, revealing her worry that she will end up like her mother. Daemon states Aemma's death was simply a tragedy, and in a tragic world, Rhaenyra cannot allow fear to control her life.In the evening, he has an outfit and the plan of a secret passage in his niece's apartments deposited. She joins him dressed as a page and they walk around town. They attend a theatrical performance mocking the royal family during which he watches his niece's reaction. Daemon points out to her that the common people prefer her half-brother to her as heir because of his gender and tells her that the people's opinion matters. Rhaenyra then steals food from a merchant and Daemon follows her through the city and catches up with her when Ser Harwin Strong intercepts the princess. He then takes her to a brothel to show her the pleasures of the flesh. Tension builds between them and they end up kissing. Daemon begins to undress her and Rhaenyra urges him to go further, but Daemon grows increasingly reluctant and stops, abandoning his niece in the middle of the night.The next morning, Daemon is awakened by Mysaria who offers him a drink to help with his green-sickness, which he refuses and rejects her protection. Mysaria informs her that she is no longer a prostitute. She tells him to pay for his room when he leaves and leaves him.Back at the castle, he is stopped by two guards and brought into the throne room. Viserys is here, and asks his brother if he defiled his daughter then kicks him. Daemon does not deny. Viserys lets out his anger against him because Rhaenyra can no longer be his heiress if she is no longer ""intact."" Daemon asks him to wed her to him and reminds him that Viserys promised him everything he wanted after his return. Viserys retorts that he is already married and Daemon argues that he can do what their ancestor Aegon the Conqueror did and have two wives. Viserys flatly refuses, believing that his brother desires his throne. Viserys orders him to return to his legitimate wife in the Vale and never to appear before him again.Daemon, back in the Vale of Arryn, surprises his wife Rhea Royce hunting. She provokes him, and Daemon approaches her horse. Rhea, believing she understands her husband's intentions, who is to kill her so he can marry Rhaenyra, tries to catch her bow, but her horse arches, causing the young woman to fall and find herself paralyzed on the ground. Daemon checks her condition then leaves. Rhea taunts him one last time, calling him a ""craven"". Daemon picks up a stone and walks towards her.Uninvited, Daemon shows up at Rhaenyra Targaryen's wedding and takes a seat at the royal table. Soon after, Gerold Royce confronts the prince and accuses him of murder. Daemon warns him that he will have to prove his charges and informs him that he intends to go to the Vale to collect his wife's inheritance. Then, he meets Laena Velaryon's gaze then joins her on the dance floor where the young woman flatters and entices him. Daemon then heads off with his niece and walks away from the dance floor with her. He tries to convince her not to marry Laenor but rather him. Rhaenyra challenges him to take her to Dragonstone and marry her. Daemon disappears during Criston Cole's assault on Laenor's lover.Ten years later, Daemon now lives in Pentos with his family. With his second wife Laena, they demonstrate the power of their dragons. In the evening, he dines with the family with his wife, his daughters Baela, Rhaena and with Prince Reggio Haratis who toasts Aegon the Conqueror then offers them permanent residence in Pentos and land in exchange for their air support against the Triarchy. When Laena is about to refuse, Daemon grabs her hand and informs the prince that they will think about it.After the meal, Daemon teaches Baela the High Valyrian. Laena joins him and asks him if he intends to accept the proposal. The prince wants to accept and no longer wants to interfere in the Westeros plot. Laena replies that they are just guests; she refuses to be a pawn and tells him of her wish to return to Driftmark to give birth, that their daughters receive the education they deserve, and that she wishes to die as a dragonrider.The next evening, Laena brings Daemon the news from King's Landing and tells him that Rhaenyra has given birth to a third son. She tries to convince him again to return by pointing out that he does not go out in the city and is content to read books to the glory of his house. Laena first thinks that her husband's behavior is her fault because she is not the woman he desired and he did not have the life he wanted. Laena tells him that she got used to this idea and that Daemon is better than he thinks.A few days later, Laena gives birth but cannot get her baby out. The surgeon informs Daemon that he can't do anything except perform a caesarean section without being sure that the child will be alive. Daemon asks if the mother will survive, the surgeon says no. Daemon does not make a decision and realizes that his wife has disappeared. He follows her to the beach and sees her helplessly being consumed by Vhagar at her command. The next day, he shows Laena's remains to their daughters from the ramparts then leave.Following Laena's death, her body is brought back to Driftmark where her funeral takes place. Vaemond Velaryon is in charge of the funeral speech during which Daemon laughs at his reflection on the blood. During the snack that follows, Daemon stays away from the others, but exchanges glances with Rhaenyra and Viserys. His brother ends up coming to see him. Daemon sees the damage of the disease on his brother. Viserys offers him to return with him to King's Landing but Daemon refuses considering that Pentos is his new home. Viserys insists but Daemon flatly refuses and leaves his brother and the place. After the funeral, Daemon talks with Rhaenyra on the beach. The princess tells his uncle about her situation with Laenor which is spiraling out of control and not even trying to keep up appearances unlike her. Rhaenyra explains to him that they tried to conceive a child, but without joy or success. She then reveals that Ser Harwin Strong is indeed the father of her three children. Rhaenyra confides that she trusted him and regrets not having held him back. Daemon believes the Hightowers are responsible for the Strong's deaths. Rhaenyra then blames Daemon for having abandoned her and that her life has become a ""droll tragedy"". The prince retorts that he spared her because she was just a child. She then questions him about his relationship with Laena. Daemon tells her they were ""happy enough"" and Rhaenyra offers her condolences. The princess then kisses him, telling her that she is no longer a child. The two go to take refuge in an abandoned wooden wreck on the beach and make love for the first time.Soon after, they return to the castle where they find that their children have fought with Aemond Targaryen. They listen to the children and then Alicent and Rhaenyra argue until Viserys asks for peace. When Alicent attempts to attack Lucerys Velaryon and his mother protects him, Daemon stops Criston Cole who is heading towards the Queen. After Alicent wounds Rhaenyra with the Valyrien steel dagger, Daemon closes in on Rhaenyra and faces Alicent.The day after, Daemon reunites with Rhaenyra. The princess offers to marry her according to Targaryen customs, in order to consolidate her place as heir to the throne. With the complicity of Ser Qarl Correy, they fake Laenor's death. Daemon kills a guard resembling the Heir of Driftmark while Qarl and Laenor pretend to quarrel in front of a servant. After Laenor's ""death"", Daemon and Rhaenyra marry at Dragonstone in front of their children and Maester Gerardys according to Targaryen customs. They cut their lips and the palm of their hand with a steel knife, mix their blood and drink it from a cup.",Daemon returns King 's Landing following journey niece Rhaenyra greets Red Keep 's throne room sitting Iron Throne .
