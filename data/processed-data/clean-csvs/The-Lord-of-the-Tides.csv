Synopsis,At High Tide,"Six years have passed since the funeral of Laena Velaryon. In the Hall of Nine, Princess Rhaenys Targaryen, attended by her granddaughter Baela Targaryen, listens to Maester Kelvyn reporting that her husband, Lord Corlys Velaryon, who has spent that time fighting to maintain Westeros's hold on the Stepstones, has been seriously wounded in an ambush by Triarchy forces. His ship is expected to return to Driftmark in three days, but his fever might claim his life by then. Ser Vaemond Velaryon, in attendance, insists that as Corlys's closest kin, he should inherit Driftmark if his elder brother dies, rather than Corlys's preferred choice of Lucerys Velaryon, who Vaemond asserts is a bastard son of Harwin Strong. When Rhaenys warns that her cousin, King Viserys, would have Vaemond's tongue for such words, Vaemond retorts that Alicent Hightower rules in Viserys's stead, and he expects her to ratify his claim to Driftmark.",Six years passed since funeral Laena Velaryon .

Synopsis,On Dragonstone,"Prince Daemon Targaryen climbs the Dragonmont, the volcano overlooking Dragonstone castle, where he recovers three dragon eggs laid by Syrax from a nest within the volcano, handing them over to the Dragonkeepers upon his return. Within the castle, a pregnant Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen watches her eldest son, Prince Jacaerys Velaryon reciting High Valyrian under the tutelage of Maester Gerardys, reassuring her son when he keeps reprimanding himself for making mistakes that he has plenty of time to learn. Rhaenyra dismisses her eldest son and his younger brother, Joffrey, along with the maester as Daemon enters, wanting to discuss a letter sent to them by Baela from Driftmark. Rhaenyra is furious at Vaemond's intentions, particularly since she expects Alicent and Otto Hightower to side with him, noting that if Lucerys's claim to Driftmark is overturned, by extension, Jace's and her own claims to the Iron Throne will be jeopardized. Rhaenyra is also concerned that the letter mentions Rhaenys has returned to court, since they cannot be sure of her intentions. Daemon confidently asserts Rhaenys will not support Vaemond, given her taking Baela as her ward. Rhaenyra argues that Rhaenys still blames them for the death of her son Laenor, and has only taken in Baela to honor her daughter Laena's memory. Both conclude that they need to return to King's Landing to fight for Luke's claim.",Prince Daemon Targaryen climbs Dragonmont volcano overlooking Dragonstone castle recovers three dragon eggs laid Syrax nest within volcano handing Dragonkeepers upon return .

Synopsis,In King's Landing,"Rhaenyra and Daemon arrive, accompanied by her three sons and Daemon's younger daughter, Rhaena, at the Red Keep, receiving a minimalist greeting with only Lord Allun Caswell in attendance. Their anger at the lack of reception only grows when they discover that in their absence, the Red Keep is now festooned with iconography of the Faith of the Seven; Rhaenyra outright states she barely recognizes her old home.In Viserys's chambers, Rhaenyra and Daemon find his model city of Old Valyria covered in dust and cobwebs, having been unattended for years. Much to their horror, Viserys is bedridden, disorientated and clearly in pain, his hair all but gone, his teeth rotten, and his face swathed in bandages. Daemon brings up the matter of Corlys being wounded in the Stepstones and the succession of Driftmark being disputed, only for a delirious Viserys to insist both are already settled. Daemon urges Viserys to support Lucerys's claim over Vaemond's, but Viserys confusedly remarks that Alicent and Otto attend to court business. A child crying out behind them draws Viserys's attention, so Rhaenyra introduces her father to his youngest grandsons from her marriage to Daemon: Aegon and Viserys. Viserys is delighted to see the children, joking the younger has a name fit for a king. The children start to wail, and Viserys, stricken by a sudden onset of pain, insists he needs his tea, pointing to a cup by his bedside. Once he has drunk, Daemon takes the cup from his brother and sniffs it, frowning as he recognizes the scent of its contents.Ser Harrold Westerling interrupts a meeting of the Small Council to inform them of Rhaenyra and Daemon's arrival. The Council briefly discusses the succession of Driftmark; Grand Maester Orwyle remarks that Corlys wanted Lucerys to succeed him, with Lord Lyman Beesbury agreeing that as Laenor's son, Lucerys is the rightful heir. Lord Jasper Wylde argues that Corlys never formally named Lucerys as his heir, while Ser Tyland Lannister notes that Lucerys has no experience commanding ships, a necessity to hold the position of Lord of the Tides. Queen Alicent declares the claimants can present their petitions the following morning, taking her leave to go and meet Rhaenyra and Daemon, only to be informed by Ser Erryk Cargyll (whom she briefly mistakes for his twin brother Arryk) there has been an incident in Prince Aegon's chambers. In the queen's apartments, Alicent's lady-in-waiting, Talya, presents the Queen with a weeping girl, Dyana, one of Princess Helaena Targaryen's maids, confirming no one else has seen her. At Alicent's request, Dyana tearfully explains that when she tried to serve Prince Aegon wine, he drunkenly forced himself on her. Alicent is sympathetic to the girl, confirming she believes that Dyana is telling the truth, but buys Dyana's silence with a pouch of gold and forces her to drink Moon tea, noting that others might dismiss her testimony. Afterwards, a furious Alicent confronts a drunken Aegon in his chambers, berating him for his assault on Dyanna, only the latest of many, bringing shame on her and his wife with his conduct, disgustedly declaring Aegon no son of hers. Aegon feebly protests at the weight of expectations placed upon him and the fact nothing he does ever satisfies his parents, but Alicent is unsympathetic. When Helaena, unaware of what has happened, enters the room and asks if anyone has seen Dyana, Alicent breaks down in tears and embraces her daughter. In Viserys's room, Rhaenyra and Daemon discuss the extent of his deterioration when Alicent enters the room. The couple outright accuse Alicent and Otto of keeping Viserys stupefied on milk of the poppy so that they can rule in his name without interference. When Alicent protests that Viserys's condition leaves him in agony and the maesters recommended such treatment, Daemon sarcastically asks if the maesters also prescribed stripping the Red Keep of Targaryen heraldry in favor of the iconography of the Seven. Alicent piously retorts such devotional displays are meant only to guide and remind of a higher authority. When Rhaenyra questions which authority will decide on her son's right to his own inheritance, Alicent smugly replies that will be her, and her father in his capacity as Hand of the King. In the Red Keep's yard, Jace fondly reminisces about their boyhood days training there, while Luke is more self-conscious of the stares of the courtiers, aware that his resemblance to Harwin Strong rather than Laenor Velaryon undermines his claim to Driftmark. The brothers notice a crowd forming around a sparring match; to their shock, they see Criston Cole duelling their uncle, Prince Aemond Targaryen, who has grown into a formidable warrior since they last met. Aemond defeats Cole, who compliments the victory, remarking Aemond will swiftly be winning tourneys before long. Aemond makes clear he has no interest in such things before noticing his nephews in the crowd, asking Jace and Luke if they've come to train with a menacing edge in his voice. Jace and Luke are saved from having to answer by the arrival of Vaemond, escorted by his retinue and several Hightower guardsmen. Vaemond meets privately with Otto and Alicent, pledging the Velaryon fleet to support them in return for acknowledging him as heir to Driftmark.In the Red Keep's godswood, Rhaenyra meets with Rhaenys, accompanied by Rhaena. Rhaenys is delighted to see her younger granddaughter, but less so Rhaenyra, who asks Rhaena leave to let the older women talk privately. Rhaenyra concludes Rhaenys is in King's Landing to advocate for her own claim to Driftmark, rather than in support of Vaemond. Rhaenyra insists that the proceedings are a trap engineered by Otto and Alicent  meant to insultingly denounce Lucerys as illegitimate; an angry Rhaenys snaps Rhaenyra did worse when she cuckolded Laenor. Rhaenyra insists that she loved Laenor in her own way and that she was uninvolved in his death. She also offers to betroth Jace and Luke to Baela and Rhaena, allowing Baela to be Jace's Queen and ensuring rule of Driftmark will pass through Laena's line by Rhaena as Rhaenys originally wished. Rhaenys seemingly rebuffs the offer, remarking that she must stand alone.That night, as a storm batters King's Landing, Rhaenyra sits at  Viserys' bedside. He awakes and briefly mistakes her for Alicent before Rhaenyra corrects him. Rhaenyra then asks her father if he believe the Song of Ice and Fire, the prophetic dream of Aegon the Conqueror, is a true prophecy. She reminds Viserys that he told her it was their duty to hold the realm united against the return of a coming evil, but warns his naming her heir divided the realm and she has found the burden of that duty a hard one to bear. Rhaenyra tearfully pleads for her father to defend her and her children if he believes the dream true, but Viserys is too delirious from pain, illness and medication to respond, and Rhaenyra weeps at the realization even her beloved father has forsaken her to fend for herself.The next morning, as Orwyle and several acolytes tend to Viserys's affliction, the king orders Otto to arrange a supper that night with all of his family in attendance, as well as refusing milk of the poppy. Later that day in the throne room, Otto, seated on the Iron Throne in Viserys's stead in his role as Hand of the King, presides over the succession of Driftmark in the event of Lord Corlys's death. Vaemond speaks first, citing House Velaryon's history as a survivor of the Doom of Valyria, as well as citing himself as Corlys's closest kin and a true heir of Velaryon blood. Rhaenyra scornfully accuses Vaemond of serving nothing but his own ambition in undermining the succession of Laenor's trueborn son and Corlys's preferred successor, only to be silenced by Alicent. Once Vaemond's petition is concluded, Otto invites Rhaenyra to speak on Lucerys's behalf. She begins by denouncing the entire proceeding as a farce, but before she can speak further, the throne room doors open and, to the incredulity of all present, Viserys hobbles into the throne room, clearly in pain but determined to support his daughter one last time. Viserys declares his intention to sit the throne and preside over the ruling, forcing Otto to withdraw. He struggles to climb the steps of the Iron Throne, initially dismissing the offer of Ser Erryk's help, but when he stumbles a second time, out of breath from exertion, his crown falls from his head and another figure steps forward to help. Viserys is about to rebuff them, when he realises it is Daemon, his face drawn by concern for his older brother, and Viserys allows Daemon to help him up the steps and place the crown upon his head once more.Viserys declares his confusion as to why a settled succession is being debated, noting the only person fit to give further insight into Corlys's wishes would be his wife, Rhaenys. Rhaenys steps forward and, to the shock and anger of Vaemond, Otto and Alicent, asserts that Corlys always wanted Lucerys to succeed him as Lord of Driftmark, a decision she supports...as she is confident Corlys would support her decision to accept Rhaenyra's proposal to betroth Jace and Luke to Baela and Rhaena. Viserys declares the matter settled, reaffirming Lucerys as heir to Driftmark and the next Lord of the Tides. An outraged Vaemond furiously snaps that Viserys has no authority to decide House Velaryon's fate when he broke centuries of tradition and Westerosi law to install his daughter as heir, angrily denouncing Lucerys as no true Velaryon. Angered by Vaemond's presumption, Viserys coldly reminds Vaemond he is nothing more than a second son, whereas Lucerys is the king's truborn grandson. Vaemond refuses to be silent, raging that he will not allow House Velaryon to end on account of Lucerys, holding his tongue before openly calling the boy a bastard. Daemon, glaring at Vaemond, dares him to say the word that will damn him, and Vaemond, too blinded by rage to hold back, bellows that Rhaenyra's children are bastards and she is a whore. As the court murmurs at this outburst, an apoplectic Viserys rises to his feet and draws his dagger, vowing to take Vaemond's tongue for the insult to his daughter's honor. Before he can, Daemon slices off the top of Vaemond's skull with Dark Sister, sardonically quipping that Vaemond ""can keep his tongue"", before casually cleaning and sheathing Dark Sister as Otto bellows at the Kingsguard to disarm Daemon. The shock and exertion overcome Viserys who collapses in pain on the throne, but despite a panicking Rhaenyra and Alicent pleading with him to take medical assistance, Viserys refuses, insisting he must make things right.Later that evening, Rhaenys watches as the Silent Sisters prepare Vaemond's body for burial. Grand Maester Orwyle urges her to leave, noting it is considered bad luck to look upon the face of death, but Rhaenys dismisses him, remarking that the Stranger, who has come for her family so many times, no longer cares if her eyes are open or closed to him.",Rhaenyra Daemon arrive accompanied three sons Daemon 's younger daughter Rhaena Red Keep receiving minimalist greeting Lord Allun Caswell attendance .
