Biography,House of the Dragon: Season 1,"At a meeting of the Small Council, Corlys urges action against the Triarchy, an alliance formed by the Free Cities, which, according to his assessment, would gravely affect Westerosi ports, but his concerns are dismissed by Viserys Targaryen, and his Hand, Ser Otto Hightower.Corlys is present at the Heir's Tournament with his wife Rhaenys, and their two children Laena and Laenor.Corlys attends the funeral of Queen Aemma and Prince Baelon.The day after the funeral, in the Small Council chamber, the matter of the succession to the Iron Throne is brought up by Otto Hightower, where Corlys supports Daemon Targaryen's claim to the Iron Throne, due to male-preference primogeniture. When Otto suggests Rhaenyra instead, Corlys offers an alternative: his wife, Rhaenys, stating that she has a valid claim to the throne, and a male heir. Before the matter can be discussed further, Viserys furiously berates the Small Council for their squabbling while he is still in mourning, and abruptly ends the meeting.Corlys is amongst several lords of Westeros who were summoned to King's Landing to swear fealty to both Viserys, and his named heir, Rhaenyra Targaryen, who is named the Princess of Dragonstone.Roughly six months after Aemma Arryn's funeral, Corlys reiterates the problems with the Triarchy, who have now sunk four Westerosi ships including one from the Velaryon fleet, gaining more power in the Stepstones, and demands to take action against the Triarchy to clear out the Stepstones. Viserys explains that, as an alternative, he has sent envoys to Pentos and Volantis, with the prospect of an alliance against the Triarchy, but Corlys warns that further inaction will only strengthen the belief that Viserys (and by extension, Westeros) is weak, which began with Daemon's illegal occupation of Dragonstone not being answered.Corlys and Rhaenys later try to forge a marriage alliance between House Targaryen and House Velaryon, by suggesting Viserys should marry their daughter, Laena Velaryon, uniting the Targaryen dragons and the Velaryon fleet, to prove the strength of his reign. Though several members of the Small Council support the idea of Viserys and Laena's union (due to its several political advantages), Viserys opts to marry Lady Alicent Hightower. Corlys, infuriated by yet another slight to his family by the Targaryens, leaves King's Landing and resigns from his position as Master of Ships. He returns to Driftmark, and propositions Daemon Targaryen to join him and his family in a war against the Stepstones, to claim glory for themselves.Three years later, Corlys and Daemon appear to be losing their war in a long and hard siege of Bloodstone, with several members of the army contemplating defecting. However, after Viserys offers to aid Daemon in his efforts with the Velaryons in the Stepstones, a counterattack is devised by Corlys's forces, led by Corlys and Daemon, and supported on dragonback by Seasmoke, ridden by Corlys's son, Ser Laenor. The Velaryon forces prevail after Daemon slays Craghas Drahar, preventing the ruin of House Velaryon. Corlys and his army crown Daemon King of the Narrow Sea and return to Driftmark.Back at Driftmark, Corlys arranges a betrothal between Laena and the son of the Sealord of Braavos. The Small Council is worried about an alliance between the Velaryons and Braavos, but the issue is solved by another betrothal between Laenor Velaryon and Rhaenyra Targaryen.Some time later, Viserys and Rhaenyra sail to Driftmark to discuss the prospective marriage alliance between Rhaenyra and Laenor, where Corlys and Rhaenys inquire about the matter of the succession to the Iron Throne. After Viserys affirms that Rhaenyra and Laenor's firstborn will inherit the Iron Throne from her, regardless of gender, Corlys asks whether their children shall take the ""Velaryon"" name, to which Viserys replies that they will, but upon the heir's ascension to the Iron Throne, the king or queen will take the name ""Targaryen,"" so the dynasty of dragons may continue. Corlys and Rhaenys then accept the union.Corlys and his family head to King's Landing for Laenor and Rhaenyra's wedding, where Viserys makes an impassioned speech about the union of the two remaining powerful Valyrian houses becoming one. Though the festivities start out well, the feast is interrupted by Ser Criston Cole's murder of one of House Velaryon's sworn swords, Ser Joffrey Lonmouth. Following the attack, Laenor and Rhaenyra are wed in a private, grim ceremony, of which their immediate family and their aides are in attendance.Roughly ten years later, Corlys and the Velaryon family learn that Corlys's daughter Laena has died in Pentos. Her remains are returned to High Tide, and a funeral is held there, with the extended Targaryen-Velaryon family all present. After Laena's burial, Corlys speaks to his grandson, Lucerys Velaryon, about his succession to Driftmark as Lord of the Tides, only to be surprised to learn that he does not wish to be the Lord of Driftmark if it means Corlys, and his father, Ser Laenor are dead. Corlys later witnesses a catatonic Laenor weeping in the water where Laena is buried, and angrily tells Ser Qarl Correy to retrieve him.Later in the night, Corlys and Rhaenys have a discussion surrounding Laena's death, in which Rhaenys places blame her death on both Daemon and the surgeons in Pentos, but Corlys tells her that she cannot place blame for an act of the gods. Rhaenys then contemplates whether this is punishment for their (namely Corlys's) relentless ambition for power. Though Corlys attempts to argue in favor of Rhaenys, she affirms that she no longer has any ambition for the Iron Throne, and that it is his ambition for power that is destroying his family piece by piece. Rhaenys then propositions Corlys to name Baela Targaryen, their eldest granddaughter by Laena, the heir to Driftmark, on the grounds that Baela is of true Velaryon blood, whereas Lucerys—Corlys's chosen heir—is not. Corlys, however, refuses on the grounds that this would only be admitting that Laenor's children are bastards, and disinheriting his line. Corlys is unconcerned with the truth of it, stating that history does not remember blood; it remembers names.Corlys and Rhaenys later enter the Hall of Nine at night, and demand answers following a fight between their grandchildren and Aemond Targaryen, which resulted in Lucerys slashing out Aemond's left eye. The next night, Laenor is apparently murdered in a duel with Ser Qarl in the Hall of Nine, and they grieve their son after finding his charred corpse (in actuality, Laenor is still alive and in exile in Essos, following a plot to fake his death orchestrated by Rhaenyra Targaryen, Daemon Targaryen, and Laenor himself). Overcome with anger and grief from having lost both of his children due to his relentless ambitions, Corlys leaves Driftmark, and returns to the fighting in the Stepstones after the Triarchy becomes resurgent.After six years of fighting in the Stepstones, Corlys is severely injured in an ambush, reportedly having his throat slashed by a corsair and falling into the sea. Due to uncertainty surrounding his longevity, there is a dispute over the question of who should succeed him: his brother Vaemond, or Lucerys, his intended and chosen heir. Lucerys is confirmed as heir by King Viserys. Rhaenys, at Rhaenyra's proposal, betroths her and Corlys's grandchildren Lucerys and Rhaena Targaryen as well as Jacaerys Velaryon and Baela Targaryen with Viserys's blessing. Soon after, Corlys's brother, Vaemond, is executed by Daemon Targaryen for insulting his wife, Rhaenyra, and her family.Alicent attempts to gain Rhaenys's support for the Greens and Prince Aegon Targaryen to claim to the Iron Throne by claiming that even Corlys abandoned her, gone for six years to fight a desperate battle and returned badly injured, leaving Rhaenys to chart her course alone. The attempt is futile, as Rhaenys respects Corlys's wishes and affirms her allegiance to Princess Rhaenyra and the Blacks.",At meeting Small Council Corlys urges action Triarchy alliance formed Free Cities according assessment would gravely affect Westerosi ports concerns dismissed Viserys Targaryen Hand Ser Otto Hightower.Corlys present Heir 's Tournament wife Rhaenys two children Laena Laenor.Corlys attends funeral Queen Aemma Prince Baelon.The day funeral Small Council chamber matter succession Iron Throne brought Otto Hightower Corlys supports Daemon Targaryen 's claim Iron Throne due male-preference primogeniture .
