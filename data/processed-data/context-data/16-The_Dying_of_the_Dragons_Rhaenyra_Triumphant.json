She sees much and more, my Alys. You were a fool to come alone.\u201d \u201cWere I not alone, you would not have come,\u201d said Daemon. \u201cYet you are, and here I am. You have lived too long, Nuncle.\u201d \u201cOn that much we agree,\u201d Daemon replied. Then the old prince bade Caraxes bend his neck, and climbed stiffly onto his back, whilst the young prince kissed his woman and vaulted lightly onto Vhagar, taking care to fasten the four short chains between belt and saddle. Daemon left his own chains dangling. Caraxes hissed again, filling the air with flame, and Vhagar answered with a roar. As one the two dragons leapt into the sky.",
