Accompanied by their entourage, they were greeted with celebration as the townspeople rejoiced at the return of their beloved monarchy. Although triumphant, the atmosphere was still fraught with uncertainty- many questions remained unanswered such as why Queen Alyssa had chosen to remain alone on Dragonstone while her husband and wife returned together. Nevertheless, House Targaryen received loyal support from its allies including Lord Vermithor, Lady Albin Massey of Leffords at the Golden Tooth and Princess Aerea Targaryen- all standing with them in a show of allegiance against would-be kings who sought to challenge them for control over Westeros."

From Dragonstone to the Free Cities and from Flea Bottom to Oldtown and Braavos, she commissioned bards, harpists and fools. Tom the Strummer was a favorite among these new court singers; his ribald songs caused even old Lord Rogar's tight lips to smile with mirth. The Goodwife was brought in as Red Keep's first fool \u2013 though her tenure there was short-lived due to her mischievous mocking of certain nobles. But in that brief time, the castle rang with more than just battlecries - jokes were exchanged, melodies flowed through its halls in glorious harmony and the glitter of Alysanne\u2019s happy court dazzled those who visited it."
