He had grown outgrown his father's rule, and now he strove to make King's Landing a thriving hub of culture and life. In order to do so, Aenys' Targaryen and Leo Lannister's eldest son joined forces in building fortifications all around Gulltown and White Harbor, while they raised walls in Oldtown which would soon be an inviting gathering place for both the wealthy and poor alike. In this way, Aegon turned what was once fragmented cities into true powerhouses that were able to weather any storms - both metaphorical ones from within the kingdoms, or literal ones like those thrown at them by Dornish cutthroats from beyond Westeros' far reaches."

It needed none, some of its residents were known to say; no enemy would ever dare attack the city so long as it was defended by the Targaryens and their dragons. The king himself might have shared these views originally, but the death of his sister Rhaenys and her dragon, Meraxes, in 10 AC and the attacks upon his own person undoubtedly gave him cause And in the 19th year After the Conquest, word reached Westeros of a daring raid in the Summer Isles, where a pirate fleet had sacked Tall Trees Town and carried off a thousand women and children as slaves, along with a fortune in plunder. The accounts of the raid greatly troubled the king, who realized that King\u2019s Landing would be similarly vulnerable to any enemy shrewd enough to fall upon the city when he and Visenya were elsewhere. Accordingly, His Grace ordered the construction of a ring of walls about King\u2019s Landing, as high and strong as those that protected Oldtown and Lannisport. The task of building them was conferred upon Grand Maester Gawen and Ser Osmund Strong, the Hand of the King. To honor the Seven, Aegon decreed that the city would have seven gates, each defended by a massive gatehouse and defensive towers. Work on the walls began the next year and continued until 26 AC.",

Even bastards born or hedge knights had been selected among them in order give up their service for something greater.

The group included young lords, old knights, tall septons, short maesters, dark Starry Sept students as well as fair-skinned bastards born of powerful hedge knights. Those chosen had all demonstrated their quick reflexes, strength and skill in battle or exhibited an exceptional level of observation skills and loyalty worthy for the great risk they needed to take in order to be part of this service.
