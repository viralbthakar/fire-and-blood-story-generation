Unfortunately, not everyone listened; a cruel and suspicious Dornish cutthroat refused her orders and slashed at her without warning. Visenya quickly deflected the blows but could not convince him to stand down. When Aegon arrived on scene, he urged Visenya to take a step back as he fiercely confronted the man who had threatened them both; eventually convincing him to leave by imposing his stern beauty and unforgiving character."

Aegon urged his sister Visenya to join him in surrendering their lives for the protection of the King- no matter the cost. As her heart raced with pride and fear, she refused even when he said he could face death alone; instead offering her own life as well so they may live together in purest white representing both nobility and finest knightly honor. Together they formed a group of 16 Targaryens who pledged themselves through chastity, obedience, courage and service until death- living out each day honoring these qualities with ferocity equally as cruel as their suspicious foes had ever seen them wield before in battle at Dornish War."
