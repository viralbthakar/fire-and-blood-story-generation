As they arrived, they soon learned that Jaehaerys' persuasive words had persuaded Septon Moon's followers to disperse throughout Westeros as promised. However, despite previous denunciations by his strange and zealous cult, Moon himself still refused to desist. He had preached anew and sinned anew against his vows; the long conflict between House Targaryen and his ragged horde was still alive. In light of this rebellion, King Maegor ordered a search for any remaining disciples within Oldtown\u2019s borders in hopes of finally bringing peace to Westeros once and for all. Outside the city walls, poor fellows from Fair Isle gathered around campfires telling tales about Queen Alyssa\u2019s wise rule and tireless endeavours for justice; this only served as further reminder of what would be at stake if Jaehaerys' rule failed."

Having already considered sending an envoy to forbid it, Jaehaerys instead chose to lead his own troops against them, pitting two kings on the field of fire and hoping that would be enough to disperse them. With some reluctance Rhaena, Alysanne and Queen Alyssa agreed- there seemed no better way without causing such slaughter. Meanwhile, down in Dorne Rhaenys Targaryen wanted nothing more than for her brother Maegor's rule over Westeros to end but little did she foresee that this could potentially put Jaehaerys on both sides of a long conflict if he persisted in having anointing completed without first persuading Septon Moon's followers to disperse."

Accompanying her on the journey was Rhaella, Aerea and Grand Maester Benifer who all stayed at Highgarden during the coronation festivities. What befell them all upon their return to King's Landing was something that none of their party could have ever observed were they to remain in the rural areas of Westeros they had originally departed from. As it been said, Lord Farman gave a grand gift to Princess Alysanne given his curiosity as he wrote in a bold and willful manner unlike other lords who were shy, timid and frightened by this sudden change in power yet terrified to speak against it."

Upon hearing news of Maegor's fall and Jaehaerys' ascension to King's Landing, Queen Rhaena accompanied by Queen Alyssa and Princess Aerea returned to Oldtown for his official coronation. The devoted crowd cheered at their arrival; required as part of Jaehaerys' coronation process. For being such a young King, he was believed to be wise beyond his years - lively, quick-witted, bold yet adventurous enough to question the status quo. Few could have imagined this child-king would one day become known as The Conquerer, sire 17 children and unite all seven kingdoms."
