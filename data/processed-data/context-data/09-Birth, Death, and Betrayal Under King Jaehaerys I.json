He spent long days guesting and holding audience with restless smallfolk as a way of announcing that he was following in Aegon\u2019s footsteps. On their return to Dragonstone, they were greeted by Ser Myles Smallwood and Lord Velaryon at the docks. Lord Velaryon said they should take some time to rest before embarking on another journey. However, Jaimehaerys had bigger plans. With a small gathering of lords and ladies including Prudence Celtigar and Septa Ysabel present in Maegor Towers, he declared that he would visit far-off lands such as Sunspear or The Arbor to find new allies for his soon-to-be kingdom. When all agreed upon it, Jaehaerys knew this decision would change everything following him forever."

They could tell from the somber expression on Lady Elissa's face that she was suffering; yet despite this, the Queen remained stone-faced, restrained in her composure. Not wanting to show any emotion to their guest, both of them called for their ladies-in-waiting whilst pleading for time alone with Elissa. Tears soon started streaming down Elissa's cheeks as she clung onto Rhaena and Aerea begging not to be sent away just yet. Even through a thin veil of tears, they could see the sorrow in her eyes emanating like a beacon in smoke-filled sky - an emotional dusk of sand settling over the Stone Drum yard. Pulling back gently they bid Lady Elissa Farman a tearful goodbye, wishing that their paths would cross again one day - unaware that history was going to write those same words into legend far sooner than anyone had realized."

She had seen death more times that she cared to remember - from distant relatives to the smallfolk who had suffered during the pestilence - but nothing compared to the grief of losing a family member so close to her. To purge her sorrows and stop them from overtaking her completely, Rhaena commanded her Kingsguard and Lady Alayne Royce over an arduous journey across Westeros with Lord Myles Smallwood then south over seas to Pentos; a place they knew they'd find solace and possibly answers. From King's Landing all the way up past Red Mountains onto Maidenpool and back again; Rhaena acted wth a mix of grief and desperation never seen nor heard before by those travelling with her.  When they finally returned back to Dragonstone, affected by what she had looked upon on this quest for clarity, peace or justice seemed almost imminent given how far everyone had come in covering this entire journey."

It was then that Lord Manfryd Redwyne spoke up, suggesting they ought to send ships out towards Pentos instead while they still can. At this point, Queen Alyssa poisioned by her thirst for power accepteraised his plan with no hesitation; she thought aloud that if they could find allies over there perhaps they could even rule all of Westeros one day."

As the cavernous new structure slowly began to dominate the landscape around Aegon's High Hill and Rhaenys's Hill, Jaehaerys proposed a grand ceremony to celebrate its completion. But before long arguing erupted amongst various lords on how best to stage such an event - some, led by Lord Redwyne himself, argued for something lavish and sumptuous while others wanted nothing more than a quick meal and then return to their respective homes. In spite of this opposition King Jaehaerys' vision ultimately prevailed but not without forgetting those who were left behind - like Queen Alysanne who had moved only recently back from Dragonstone -as they would remain in King's Landing while their superiors went out into more merry pastures."
