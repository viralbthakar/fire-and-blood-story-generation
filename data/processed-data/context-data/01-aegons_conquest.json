Not so. The day of Aegon\u2019s Landing was celebrated by the king and his descendants, but the Conqueror actually dated the start of his reign from the day he was crowned and anointed in the Starry Sept of Oldtown by the High Septon of the Faith. This coronation took place two years after Aegon\u2019s Landing, well after all three of the major battles of the Wars of Conquest had been fought and won.
