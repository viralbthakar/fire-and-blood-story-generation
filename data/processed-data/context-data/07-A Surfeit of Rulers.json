His heart's rebellion was acted in plain sight of all those who surrounded him, due to his own haste for true love. Thankfully, Jaehaerys repented before any real harm could befall him and so the marriage stood in the face of it all despite strict adherence to monarchical rules that had grown fearful and shaken in the wake of Queen Alyssa Velayron's daring acts against tradition which had been openly debated by Scholars wishing her not to offend religions beliefs yet again. With Jaehaerys' brave defiance came repentance for his rashness and a golden ring for Aerea, who soon thereafter became known as the queen with many hearts thanks to all she\u2019d endured."

Though they found it distasteful to rely on other kingdoms\u2019 accounts of events at Dragonstone, most accepted that Jaehaerys, his little queen Alysanne and Lady Lucinda indeed kept true to what had been intended from day one: prevent a baser loyalty between themselves and any other outland forces. As with all decisions regarding Aegon\u2019s Dynasty - such as the council of councillors who advised Queen Alyssa after her husband\u2019s death- it seemed for now that the low sense of certain proprieties had been kept, even if it  resulted in some resentment among Lord Rogar and his siblings."

Accompanied by Ser Theo Bolling and a few other Knights of the Kingsguard, they were dressed in all their finery as befitted an event of this grandeur. As soon as his coronation at the Iron Throne was complete, Jaehaerys took charge of his own rule and set about repairing the Seven Kingdoms that had been broken for so many years. With each Lord he visited: Eyrie in The Vale of Arryn; Highgarden in The Reach; Three Towers on Claw Island; and even Rook\u2019s Rest on Driftmark - his good nature was well known to foster friendship in all corners, so much so it only earned him goodwill when he later declared barring fealty to any one house in favour of collective loyalty at large. His Grace may have played a role in events still yet to relate but what can't be omitted is Aegon's fabled Dreamfyre headered happily through Westeros - a sign seen faraway throughout Seven Kingdoms - one declaring his reign forever more powerful than any before him."

On Dragonstone, where two sisters and three queens were said to have been born along with Prince Aegon the Uncrowned, Lord Rogar continued his depraved ways with further conquest of those whose names go unspoken.
