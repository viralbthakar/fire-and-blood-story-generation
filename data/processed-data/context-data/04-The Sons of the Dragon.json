Everyone seemed eager to answer his call but nevertheless were unable to comprehend why Aenys wanted him as only whispers had been heard about the lord's sudden disappearance from the realm a few moons prior. This roused suspicion in everyone but regardless they all obliged their king by riding off northward together in search of Lord Corbray.

His legions marched around Oldtown ensuring that none would stand against their king; many leal subjects who followed orders found themselves released from prison but for the poor folk wrapped in unwarranted hatred there was no mercy."

The prince was greeted upon arrival by Lord Lucas Harroway and other important lords from House Tyrell, wishing him well and hoping for his safe return from Dragonstone. When he arrived at the castle, Lord Peake\u2019s son loudly proclaimed the Prince\u2019s return as the Conqueror entered through the gates of Dragonstone on Vermithor and Silverwing followed closely behind by Maegor and Queen Visenya in tow. However, there were rumors about Prince Viserys having planned to steal away with dragons after hearing about his mother's death but no matter what rumors may have said or not said, he returned back to seat himself again upon The Iron Throne. After few days an arrest warrant was signed under orders of Maegor Targaryen which commanded all men of Kingsguard to seize Prince Viserys and chain him up in black irons while secretly questioning him regarding Mother Conquerer's burial arrangements whilst making sure none could go against King Maegor's commands on this matter any more."

Sure enough, when His Grace made another visit with an entourage of famous knights like Knight Warrior's Sons' Ser Harys Hill for protection - all hell broke loose as those opposing him raised arms against them. When those Poor Fellows were slaughtered or died trying; Queen Visenya Targaryen's son Prince Maegor managed to make off with a few alive in his wake but it was too little too late for many as Lord Tully of Riverrun declared this last stand a loss before voicing what everyone had been dreading: \"It is over\"."

The Kingsguard who were there presided over by Maegor paid no heed to her cries. In their eyes, her claim seemed impossible to believe that one so close to them had done such an act. The Queen swore on her life that it was true and Maegor forced his will upon them, acting as if he already knew it was true from the start. As Elinor stormed out of the Red Keep, she quickly vanished into unknown territory leaving only whispers of her story behind like a bloodied trail marking those left alive and those long gone; pale reminders of what had occured amongst jagged rocks stained red with blood."

Rumors began to spread like wildfire throughout the Seven Kingdoms- his body was burned beyond recognition and then secretly interred at Dragonstone. By dawn's light most believed something sinister had taken place but no one knew what strange practices were undertaken that fateful night or why King Maegor's remains had left Westeros unannounced for an unknown location leaving many questions about his death alive and hidden forever."
