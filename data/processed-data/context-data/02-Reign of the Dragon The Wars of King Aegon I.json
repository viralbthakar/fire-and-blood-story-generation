Lord Oakheart argued that it was too soon and that it would only encourage fresh rebellions, but Queen Visenya dismissed them strongly. With a heavy heart she agreed with her sister, daring anyone to suggest otherwise and refusing to forget how their beloved mother had suffered grievously during her campaign in Dorne. Aegon's brother Prince Nymor was cautious about granting forgiveness so easily but agreed for the good of his beloved kingdom. Lucan Tyrell, Lord of Highgardeners from Reach and Harlan Tyrell from The Marches joined in unison; joining Lucan they said they were weary after all these years and dared any opposition to stand in their way since they had all suffered greatly by now."
