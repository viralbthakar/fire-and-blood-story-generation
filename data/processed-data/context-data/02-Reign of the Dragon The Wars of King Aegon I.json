Here he treated with Princess Meria, negotiating to have her people recognize him as their ruler in exchange for guarantees of autonomy. Fortunately she agreed and so Aegon had practically brought all of Westeros under his banner without any major warfare - only suffering a ruined fort due to Lord Quenton's unsuccessful attempt at rebellion before assuring success in his master plan."

The Old Lord had led an army through the Prince\u2019s Pass and into the Reach, burning a dozen villages and capturing Nightsong. In response, King Aegon flew Balerion to Highgarden to contemplate another invasion of Dorne, this time using Ser Addam at its head. Ser Addam was a valiant knight from House Martell ready to raise Dornia's banner in retaliation against Lord Hightower' injustices. Theo Tyrell, however, cautioned him that Garmon Qorgyle's spearmen proved too strong for former attempts and suggested that they try again with more strength and resources; something in which Aegon readily agreed on returning back to Oldtown."

Lord Edmyn Tully had once famously said \"Nothing stands against dragons\" and this seemed to prove true as not even Oberyn Martell's Qorgyle spearmen could halt the Fall of Dorne. From Starfall back to Old Wyk, no castle or strong hall were spared from wildfire or dragon breath - even full-grown castles of harder-than-steel stone were caught in its wicked flames causing those within them to writhe in mortal agony. With their enemies defeated by their sheer power, the Targaryens took precious resources back with them from Dorne although suffered little harm from their campaign themselves. This event triggered Aegon's desire to contemplate another invasion that would finally bring Justice for himself; thus signalling the start of an era where Westeros stood at a critical juncture with nowhere else left to conquer beyond Dorne except what lies across The Narrow Sea - making King Aegon I's reign heralded now as 'Aegon's Conquest'."
