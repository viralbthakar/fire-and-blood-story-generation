It was then that Argella Tyrell argued he could succeed where Argilac the Storm King had failed before him: if Aegon were to wed his sisters Vhagar and Meraxes in equal measure to all houses sworn to him - including House Baratheon, House Lannister and Harrens father House Hoare - then honors would be given without dishonor as no house would take precedence over another. To this suggestion Aegon whispered an angry reply but was more subtly moved by it later when Orys Baratheon\u2019s baseborn status meant that his union with Valaena Targaryen was impossible unless Aegon gave them both his solemn blessing."

Before he could do that, Queen Sharra of the Vale had taken refuge in Eyrie with her daughter Sharra Arryn. Aegon sent an army to sway her with promises, but she would have none of it. In response, Sharra offered herself to him in marriage if he spared her lands. She was a faded flower bloomed late by then so Aegon refused but agreed to spare the Valesmen in exchange for fealty. The lords Errol, Mooton's brother and Father took this offer and declared themselves bannerman of House Targaryen - sealing their fate as well as Storm's End forever under Targaryen rule."

The Dornishmen were gone or deserted; only an easy river remained to be crossed before coming between Red Mountains and White Stone over Empty Deserted land towards Eyrie in Vale of Arryn.

She smiled thinking how things were different now. At her call Harlan Tyrell sent Lord Bar Emmon with Buckler to join them so if they could both speak together then Mooton\u2019s brother could learn more quickly how to exchange leathery wings for a strong host in few days if needed.

Among them was Harlan Tyrell, who had traveled all the way from Highgarden, as well as Lord Bar Emmon of Pebbleton and Lords Errol, Buckler and Hooks of the Riverlands. They cheered loudly as Aegon was crowned king in Starry Sept and rode with him to Oldtown for his second coronation at The Citadel. At his final coronation, something even more magical happened: Balerion himself appeared just outside of Blackwater Rush in a massive display of fire and smoke - a gift from Valyria that united House Targaryen with its two remaining dragons. There were cheers as crowds gathered to watch Aegonfort being built atop three hills on the blackwater bay which signaled the crowning Aegon I Targaryen King of Seven Kingdoms."

His last sons Aerys and Rhaegar would continue this rise to power by holding their ancestral home of Dragonstone firmly at its center. Peril was everywhere but nothing held back the ambition of their royal dynasty; they knew they had to prevail against adversity or risk crumbling before even reaching Kings Landing."
