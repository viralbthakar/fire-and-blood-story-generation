The Dornish lords deserted their castles easily and even those who had guarded Prince's Pass were gone.

After receiving anointment with the seven oils, a crown was placed upon his head and he was proclaimed to be 'Aegon of House Targaryen', destined to conquer Seven Kingdoms. His second coronation took place in Oldtown after completing a tour across Blackwater, where many cheered for him even though it lacked grandeur compared to his first. When Aegonfort was finished being constructed at the mouth of Blackwater Rush, Balerion - one of Aegon's dragons - fixed its position as capital by landing upon its parapets while bearing Aegon on its back. The lords both present and in attendance cheered when they saw how victorious their lord looked; indeed, it seemed like there truly could not have been a better way to celebrate his crowning than this very moment."

Everywhere they went crowds cheered for them as they rode Balerion, Visenya and Meraxes across Westeros.

He set up ancient castles as strongholds to declare his rule while rising forces such as Lords Fell and Buckler from Storm combined with Gardeners from The Reach held perilous positions throughout the continent. With each proclamation a new legend was born as Harren the Black, Loren of House Lannister and Targaryen host including Lord Aenar's maiden daughter Daenys Aerys yielded to make way for what is now remembered as one of the great conquerors in history - Aegon I Targaryen."
