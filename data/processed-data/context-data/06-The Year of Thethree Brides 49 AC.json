While the situation might have felt dire for some, she dreamed what wonders their marriage would bring to Westeros - although Maegor wasn't happy with these results and after seeing this turn of events unfold before him, he remained unsuprised as well."

At thiswords, all seven men drew their swords and shouted in unison: \"come no closer! Sheath your steel and move aside\". The Princess and her brother stood firm, proclaiming that if any were to come closer they would be cut to pieces. Lord Rogar stepped back and nodded proudly at them; \"Kill us then\", he said. \"But know that I will be the first to die.\" Good - it pleased him that these two Targaryens would not be easily cowed. With a slight bow, Lord Rogar motioned for his escort to continue on their way as he gently ushered the children back into safety."
