 On the first page of ads, a period was added after "THE LITTLE WOMEN SERIES. New Illustrated Edition".
 On the second page of ads, in the blurb for the book Comic Tragedies, a period as placed after "Portraits, etc".
 After the novel is a list of The Works of Louisa May Alcott. The list is not complete: for example, there are no listings for her work as Flora Fairfield or A.Â M. Barnard. Nevertheless, the pages are a fine structured outline of Ms. Alcott's best work.
 Most of the novels and stories in these four pages are published by Project Gutenberg. We included links to these titles for the reader's convenience. A change had to be made for one item: We had to list each of the three volumes of Lulu's Library to provide the links to that book. These links will only work in the HTML document.
 The final page is a listing of eleven stories originally published in other volumes, such as Jo's Scrap-Bag, Lulu's Library, and A Garland for Girls. These works were subsequently published separately in small volumes, generally less than 100 pages, in The Children's Friend Series.
